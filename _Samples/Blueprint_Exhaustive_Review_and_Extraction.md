# DNDAI Blueprint: Extraction and Review Process

## Purpose
A step-by-step operational blueprint for exhaustively reviewing every file and folder in the DNDAI workspace, extracting actionable content, and generating new documents as required.

## Steps
1. Recursively list every file and folder in the workspace.
2. For each file, perform a full, line-by-line review of its entire content.
3. Log the review status and findings for every file (including empty, binary, or non-text files).
4. Extract all actionable content, ideas, and relevant information line by line.
5. Create new blueprints, prompt templates, scripts, or documentation as required, based solely on the reviewed content.
6. Summarize actionable patterns and operational logic for each new document.
7. Log all new documents and improvements in a running improvement log.
8. Periodically summarize and compact all extracted content for each file, folder, and category.
9. Update blueprints, prompts, and instructions with improved versions as new insights are gained.
10. Maintain a running log of summaries and compactions for traceability.

## Notes
- Do not use any legacy indices, outlines, or cross-references to direct or filter this process.
- Ensure every file, including empty, binary, or non-text files, is logged and reviewed.
- Continue without interruption until all steps are complete.
