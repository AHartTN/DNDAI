# Worldbuilding & Game Mechanics Blueprint

## World Structure

- Cosmology & planes (Prime Material, Feywild, Shadowfell, Elemental, Outer)
- Regions, kingdoms, and maps (sample: Kingdom of Ashvale, Duchy of Blackmoor)
- Lore, history, and timelines (creation myths, epoch breakdowns)
- Factions, organizations, and cultures (knightly orders, guilds, cults)
- Races, subraces, and custom cultures (humans, elves, dwarves, custom)

**Sample Table: Regions**
| Region         | Description                | Major Factions         |
|---------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|
| Ashvale       | Fertile kingdom, forests   | Royal Guard, Mages    |
| Blackmoor     | Marshy, mysterious         | Shadow Cult, Merchants|

## Core Mechanics

- Stats, skills, and proficiencies (Strength, Arcana, Stealth, etc.)
- Spell schools, class lists, and archetypes (Abjuration, Bard, Witch)
- Backgrounds, features, and advancement systems (Acolyte, Milestone XP)
- Variant rules and campaign-specific mechanics (custom feats, planar magic)

**Sample Stat Block Template:**
```
Name: [NPC/Monster]
Type: [Humanoid/Beast/Undead]
Stats: STR ##, DEX ##, CON ##, INT ##, WIS ##, CHA ##
Skills: [List]
Abilities: [List]
HP: ##  AC: ##  Speed: ##
Special: [Unique traits]
```

## Encounter & Creature Design

- Monster roles and templates (Brute, Controller, Skirmisher, etc.)
- Random encounter tables by terrain (forest, swamp, mountain, urban, etc.)
- Boss/solo frameworks and advanced combat mechanics (legendary actions, lair actions)
- Monster customization: hybrids, mutations, enhancements, planar variants

**Sample Encounter Hook:**
- "In the Blackmoor marsh, a shadow cultist and a mutated dire wolf ambush travelers at dusk."

## DM Tools

- Narration and pacing templates (scene framing, read-alouds)
- Improv and player agency tools (random tables, collaborative hooks)
- Session management and templates (recaps, flows, downtime)
- Calculators, generators, and planning sheets (encounter balance, loot)

**Sample Session Template:**
1. Opening recap
2. Scene setup
3. Encounter flow
4. Downtime activities
5. Closing summary
