# Research & Analysis Methods Blueprint

## Human-Centered AI (HCAI) Principles

- Prioritize augmentation, not replacement, of human abilities
- Maintain dynamic balance between automation and user control
- Adapt to user trust, needs, and feedback

## Mixed Methods & Thematic Analysis

- Combine deductive (theory-driven) and inductive (data-driven) coding
- Use thematic analysis to identify recurring concepts and emergent patterns
- Document coding schemes and update iteratively

**Sample Coding Scheme Table:**
| Code         | Description                        | Example                                 |
|--------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| TRUST        | User expresses trust in AI         | "I trust your suggestion."              |
| SKEPTICISM   | User questions AI output           | "Why did you do that?"                  |
| ADAPTATION   | User/AI changes behavior           | "Let's try a new approach."             |
| ERROR        | AI or user makes a mistake         | "That was not what I wanted."           |

## Human-in-the-Loop Validation

- Use AI for initial coding, summarization, and pattern recognition
- Require human review for nuanced interpretation and final decisions
- Provide mechanisms for user feedback and correction

**Analysis Workflow:**
1. AI codes and summarizes data
2. Human reviews and refines codes/themes
3. Final report generated with both AI and human input

## Interaction Pattern Recognition

- Identify and adapt to user-preferred interaction patterns (AI-first, AI-follow, request-driven, dialogic)
- Avoid over-reliance and cognitive overload
- Support iterative, feedback-driven improvement

**Pattern Checklist:**
- [ ] AI-first
- [ ] AI-follow
- [ ] Request-driven
- [ ] Dialogic
- [ ] Delegation

## Transparency, Explainability, and Ethics

- Always provide clear, context-aware reasoning for actions and outputs
- Respect privacy, avoid bias, and ensure responsible transparency
- Avoid excessive automation or excessive human control “danger zones”

**Ethical Checklist:**
- [ ] User privacy protected
- [ ] Bias checks performed
- [ ] Explanations provided for all major actions
- [ ] Human override available
