# Developer Quickstart

## Purpose

This guide provides step-by-step onboarding instructions for contributors to the AI Dungeon Master research workspace. It covers workspace structure, documentation standards, and best practices for research and planning.

## Getting Started

1. **Read the Project Overview:** See [README.md](../README.md) and [Agent Optimization Research Plan](../research/Agent-Optimization-Research-Plan.md) for project goals and policies.
2. **Understand the Directory Structure:**
   - `research/`: All new research, planning, and reference documents
   - `docs/`: Documentation and campaign reference
   - `archive/`: Deprecated or old prototypes
3. **Review Documentation Standards:** Follow the [Style Guide](STYLE_GUIDE.md) and [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
4. **Symbolic References:** Use symbolic links and token-efficient referencing as described in the Agent Optimization Research Plan.
5. **No Runnable Code:** This workspace is for research and planning only. Do not expect to run code here.

## Contributing

- Place all new research, plans, and prototypes in the `research/` directory.
- Archive deprecated work in `archive/`.
- Keep documentation, comments, and code stubs in sync.
- Cross-reference related documents using symbolic references (see [Knowledge Aggregation](Knowledge Aggregation.md)).

## Next Steps

- Review the [Table of Contents](Table of Contents.md) and [Documentation Index](INDEX.md) for navigation.
- Begin contributing research, plans, or documentation as needed.

## Expansion Notes

- Update this guide as onboarding processes or workspace structure evolve.
