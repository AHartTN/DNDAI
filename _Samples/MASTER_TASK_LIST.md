# DNDAI Autonomous Master Task List (Imperative, Stepwise, Self-Improving)

## 1. Workspace Initialization and Audit

1. Recursively inventory every file and folder in the workspace. Do not skip or filter any files.
2. For each file, log its review status and findings (including empty, binary, or non-text files) in `_Autogenerated`.
3. Maintain a dedicated `_Autogenerated` folder for all new/generated content. Never mix outputs with originals.
4. Generate and update blueprints, prompt templates, and process logs in `_Autogenerated` as operational artifacts.

## 2. Exhaustive Extraction and Review (Atomic, Uninterrupted)

1. For every file in `Research/`, `_Samples/`, and `worldbuilding/`, perform a full, atomic, line-by-line review and extraction of actionable content, ideas, and operational logic. Do not pause, skip, or request input for any reason.
2. After reviewing each file, immediately log all findings and actionable extracts in a dedicated `FileReviewLog_<filename>.md` in `_Autogenerated`.
3. Mark each file as fully reviewed and processed in the checklist below.
4. Ensure all outputs are strictly separated from original files (no mixing).

## 3. Synthesis, Compaction, and Blueprint Evolution

1. After each batch of file reviews, summarize and compact all extracted content for each file, folder, and category.
2. Synthesize new or improved blueprints, prompt templates, and process docs based on all extracted content.
3. Maintain a running log of summaries and compactions for traceability in `_Autogenerated`.

## 4. Quality Assurance, Iteration, and Self-Improvement

1. Review all new outputs for completeness, coherence, and improvement opportunities.
2. Iterate on ambiguous, incomplete, or weak areas using advanced reasoning (Tree of Thought, ReAct, Reflexion, etc.).
3. Validate that all files and dependencies are covered and cross-referenced.
4. Maintain a running log of reasoning, choices, and improvements in `_Autogenerated/Process_Running_Improvement_Log.md`.

## 5. Final Review, Documentation, and Handoff

1. Ensure all actionable content is captured, organized, and ready for further work or handoff.
2. Document lessons learned, next steps, and improvement opportunities.
3. Archive obsolete or superseded files as needed.
