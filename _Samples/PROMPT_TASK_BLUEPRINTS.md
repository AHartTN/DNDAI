# Prompt Task Blueprints & Modular Process Templates

This file contains reusable prompt/task templates and process blueprints to maximize efficiency, parallelism, and completeness during workspace review and extraction.

## 1. Systematic File Review Blueprint

**Purpose:** Ensure every file is reviewed in its entirety, with key concepts and actionable items extracted and checklist updated.

**Template:**
1. Read file in large, logical chunks.
2. For each chunk, extract:
   - Key concepts
   - Actionable items
   - Cross-file dependencies
3. Summarize findings for the file.
4. Mark file as reviewed in the checklist.
5. Log any new blueprint/process needs discovered.

## 2. Parallel File Processing Blueprint

**Purpose:** Where feasible, process multiple files in parallel to maximize throughput.

**Template:**
1. Identify files that can be processed in parallel (e.g., independent docs).
2. For each file, apply the Systematic File Review Blueprint.
3. Aggregate results and update checklist.

## 3. Key Concept & Actionable Item Extraction Blueprint

**Purpose:** Standardize extraction of actionable content from any file.

**Template:**
- For each section or logical unit:
  - What is the main idea?
  - What actions or changes does this suggest?
  - Are there dependencies or references to other files?
- Document findings in a structured format.

---

## 4. Cross-File Dependency Mapping Blueprint

**Purpose:** Track and map dependencies between files for later synthesis and QA.

**Template:**
- For each actionable item, note any referenced files, modules, or data.
- Update a dependency map or log as you process.

## 5. Synthesis & Compaction Routine Blueprint

**Purpose:** Periodically summarize and compact extracted content for each category/folder.

**Template:**
1. After processing a logical group (e.g., a folder), aggregate all key findings.
2. Summarize into a concise, actionable format.
3. Update blueprints, prompts, and instructions as needed.
4. Log summary in the running log for traceability.

(Reference and update these blueprints as you process the workspace. Add new templates as new needs or optimizations are discovered.)
