# Master Outline: Topics, Techniques, and Actionable Items

## 1. Agent Optimization & Prompt Engineering
- Token efficiency: symbolic references, chain-of-symbol, prompt chaining
- Context management: @workspace, #file, symbolic linking
- Long-context strategies: prompt chaining, history management
- Modular prompt design for complex tasks

## 2. System Architecture & Workflows
- Modular AI architecture: narrative engine, encounter generator, NPC builder, item generator, visual asset pipeline, bot interface
- API/data contracts for each module
- Configuration management: env vars, config.yaml, validation
- Sample workflows: campaign generation, encounter resolution, image asset creation

## 3. Worldbuilding & Game Mechanics
- World structure: cosmology, regions, history, factions, races, cultures
- Core mechanics: stats, skills, spells, classes, backgrounds, advancement
- Encounter/creature design: roles, templates, random tables, boss frameworks
- DM tools: narration, improv, session management, templates, calculators

## 4. Research & Analysis Methods
- Human-centered AI (HCAI) principles
- Mixed methods: deductive/inductive coding, thematic analysis
- Human-in-the-loop validation
- Interaction pattern recognition and adaptation
- Transparency, explainability, and ethical safeguards

## 5. Documentation & Onboarding
- Developer quickstart, style guide, glossary, index
- Symbolic references for cross-linking
- Contribution and documentation standards

## 6. Prompts & Scripts
- Blueprint for campaign, encounter, and asset prompts
- Modular script stubs for agent tasks
- Instruction templates for agent behaviors
