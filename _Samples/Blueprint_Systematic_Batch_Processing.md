# DNDAI Blueprint: Systematic Batch Processing

## Purpose
A blueprint for processing all files in logical batches for efficiency, ensuring every line of every file is reviewed and actionable content is extracted.

## Steps
1. Divide the full file inventory into logical batches (by folder, type, or size).
2. For each batch:
   - Review every file line by line.
   - Extract and log actionable content.
   - Create new documents, templates, or scripts as required.
   - Mark each file as fully reviewed and processed in the task list.
   - Log all actions in the running improvement log.
3. Repeat until all files are processed.

## Notes
- No file is skipped, regardless of type or content.
- Continue without interruption until all batches are complete.
