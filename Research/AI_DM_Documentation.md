6. Cadet Branches, Branch Families & Royal Kin
A noble house is never just its head—there’s a whole web of younger sons, daughters, cousins and cadet lines. This section defines how branch families form, what titles they bear, their roles in succession and court, and gives you the building blocks to spin off dozens of interrelated houses in your world generator.
6.1. Key Terms
Primogeniture
Eldest male (or, in some realms, eldest child) inherits the main title, lands and senior branch status.
Cadet Branch
Male‐line descendants of younger sons granted appanages (small domains, courtesy or substantive titles).
• They keep the family name with heraldic “marks of cadency.”
• They often serve in military, ecclesiastical or diplomatic roles.
Appanage
A parcel of land, income or courtesy title granted to a younger child so they can maintain noble status without dividing the core patrimony.
Courtesy Title
A style used by non‐inheriting children: e.g. Lord Arthur of Dunwich (younger son of a duke) or Lady Marianne (daughter of an earl), without holding a substantive peerage seat.
6.2. Family‐Branch Structure
Senior Branch
• Head of House (e.g. Duke of Ashvale)
• Heir Apparent (courtesy Marquess of Greendale)
• “Spare” (younger sons styled Lord X; daughters styled Lady Y)
Typical household: head + spouse + 2–6 children.
1st Cadet Branch
• Founded by 2nd son (e.g. Earl of Blackmoor)
• Holds a small earldom or viscounty as substantive title
• Retinue: 3–10 knights/squires + 10–30 household staff
2nd Cadet Branch
• Founded by 3rd son or younger (e.g. Viscount of Redford)
• May receive only a courtesy viscountcy and a manor
• Retinue: 1–5 knights/squires + 5–15 servants
Daughters’ Lines
• Daughters marry into other houses or remain at court
• Styled “Lady X of [Father’s Title]”; they forge alliances via marriage
• Often become ladies-in-waiting, abbesses, or wardens of royal convents
Collateral Kin (Cousins, Uncles, Aunts)
• First cousins may command armies or embassies
• Uncles/Aunts of the monarch often hold governorships or ecclesiastical offices
• Distant cousins can ascend if senior lines go extinct
6.3. Branch Counts & Roles
6.4. Succession & Branch Elevation
Extinction of Senior Line
A cadet branch “ripples up” to become the new senior line.
• Example (fictional): House of Ashvale’s 1st cadet Earl of Blackmoor ascends as Duke when the main line dies out.
Elevation by Decree
Kings can elevate a cadet branch: Viscount → Earl, Earl → Duke as reward for loyalty or military service.
Marriage‐Based Alliances
A cadet daughter marries a foreign prince, spawning cross‐house cadet branches with hybrid titles.
6.5. Heraldic & Naming Conventions
House Name + Territorial Designation
• “House Ashvale” → “Earl of Blackmoor” (cadet) → “House Blackmoor” as branch name.
Marks of Cadency
• Bendlet, mullet or label on the coat of arms to indicate 2nd, 3rd sons (common in European heraldry).
Courtesy Prefix/Suffix
• Younger sons: “Lord [Forename] [Surname]”
• Daughters: “Lady [Forename] [Surname]”
• Heirs: styled with their courtesy peerage (e.g. “Marquess of Greendale”).
6.6. Sample Genealogical Schema
House Ashvale (Dukedom, senior branch)
│
├─ Duke Robert I (head)
│ ├─ Heir: Marquess Lionel of Greendale
│ ├─ Lord Cedric (younger son)
│ └─ Lady Miriel (daughter)
│
├─ 1st Cadet: Earl Thomas of Blackmoor
│ ├─ Lord Edmund (heir, courtesy Viscount of Stonefell)
│ └─ Lady Helena
│
└─ 2nd Cadet: Viscount Elaine of Redford
├─ Lord Martin (son)
└─ Lady Ysabel (daughter)
Use this framework to spin off dozens of branch families—each with its own small court, retinue, heraldry and narrative hooks. Your MCP can now generate cadet lines, courtesy‐title courtiers, extinction‐and-ascension events, and cross-house alliances effortlessly.
