# File Review Log: Research/Agent Optimization Research Plan_.md

## Atomic, Granular Extraction

### Section 1: Agentic Reasoning & Token Efficiency
- **ReAct Framework:** Interleaves thought-action-observation; enables feedback loop, robust task tracking, and error mitigation.
- **Tree of Thoughts (ToT):** Explores multiple solution paths, uses state evaluation and search algorithms (BFS/DFS), improves complex planning but is token-intensive.
- **Symbolic Linking:** Token-efficient file/directory referencing using aliases; reduces prompt size, enables long-chain task execution.
- **Prompt Chaining:** Breaks tasks into discrete, manageable steps; improves reliability, debugging, and context management.
- **Prompt Compression:** Uses tools (e.g., LLMLingua) to reduce context size while preserving semantics.

### Section 2: Robustness, Self-Correction & Guardrails
- **Failure Modes:** Conversational drift, lack of self-awareness, adversarial attacks (prompt injection, "foot-in-the-door").
- **Metacognitive Prompting:** Structured self-evaluation (interpretation, judgment, critical evaluation); prompts agent to question its own reasoning.
- **Reflexion Framework:** Actor-Evaluator-Reflection loop; stores feedback in episodic memory, enables iterative self-improvement.
- **Constitutional AI:** Non-negotiable system rules (security, code quality, task adherence); uses instruction hierarchy to prevent override by user input.
- **Practical Guardrails:** System prompt delimitation, explicit override prevention, instruction repetition for reinforcement.

### Section 3: Copilot Agent Architecture & Extensibility
- **Agentic Loop:** Iterative plan-act-evaluate; monitors output, self-corrects, iterates until success or limit.
- **Prompt Augmentation:** Copilot backend augments user prompt with workspace summary, OS, tool descriptions.
- **Context Management:** Hierarchical instruction files (.github/copilot-instructions.md, .github/instructions/*.md, .github/prompts/*.md); supports org, repo, file, and task scope.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** Open standard for tool integration; enables custom tool/server creation, secure user consent, JSON-RPC primitives (resources, tools, prompts).

### Section 4: Synthesis & Automation
- **Project Scaffolding Script:** Multi-stage pipeline (env setup, git init, config gen, agent invocation); cross-platform, robust, automates full project setup.
- **Developer Role Evolution:** From coder to AI orchestrator; defines goals, rules, and tools, delegates execution to agentic systems.

## Operational Logic & Actionable Content
- All agentic reasoning, self-correction, and guardrail frameworks are to be encoded as reusable prompt templates and instruction files.
- Token efficiency, context management, and extensibility (MCP) are to be enforced in all agent workflows.
- Project scaffolding and automation scripts should be production-grade, cross-platform, and leverage Copilot agent orchestration.
- Security, code quality, and task adherence must be enforced via constitutional directives and instruction hierarchy.
