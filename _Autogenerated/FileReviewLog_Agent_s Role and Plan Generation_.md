# File Review Log: Agent_s Role and Plan Generation_.md

## Atomic Extraction of Actionable Content and Operational Logic

### Phase 1: Research Objective Decomposition & Dynamic Scope Definition
- **Hierarchical Planning:**
  - Decompose high-level research goals into a tree of objectives and granular sub-tasks (Gemini sub-planner).
  - Enable dynamic, evolving objectives based on new discoveries and feedback.
- **Dynamic Adaptation:**
  - Implement "Goal Re-evaluation Triggers" to adapt plan when execution deviates from expected outcomes.
  - Use structured observation, reflection, and replanning at multiple agent levels (execution, sub-planner, planner).
  - Meta-learning: System learns to improve its own planning heuristics over time.

### Phase 2: Advanced Document Access & Data Governance Strategy
- **Data Access:**
  - Use APIs (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, FAOSTAT, World Bank, NASA, Copernicus) for literature, structured, and geospatial data.
  - Employ advanced OCR and computer vision for unstructured/scanned documents.
- **Contextual Security:**
  - OAuth 2.0 + OIDC for agent authentication/authorization; use least-privilege, just-in-time access.
  - Grant type selection (client credentials, authorization code with PKCE) based on context.
  - Scope management: Always request minimal permissions.
- **Data Governance:**
  - Use Microsoft Purview for data classification, DLP, lineage tracking, and compliance.
  - Enforce DLP policies to prevent data exfiltration and control AI prompt usage.
  - Schema validation/adaptation to handle evolving data sources.

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Content Review & Analysis Methodology
- **AI Techniques:**
  - NLP for literature review and targeted extraction.
  - ML (Random Forest, GBM, LSTM) for correlation modeling and prediction.
  - Computer vision/OCR for extracting data from visual elements.
  - Cross-modal analysis for synthesizing multi-source insights.
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):**
  - Mandatory checkpoints for human expert review at key stages (data, model, synthesis, final report).
  - Hybrid workflow: AI performs initial pass, humans validate and correct.
- **Bias & Hallucination Mitigation:**
  - Require source-grounded, cited outputs; cross-verification agent for fact-checking.
  - Analyze data provenance for bias; require "Limitations" section in reports.

### Phase 4: Multi-Level Iterative Refinement & Self-Correction Plan
- **Feedback Loops:**
  - Multi-layered feedback: execution → sub-planner → planner → all levels.
  - Reflexion paradigm: Agents generate verbal self-reflections on failures, stored in persistent memory.
  - ReAct paradigm: Explicit thought-action-observation loop for all multi-step tasks.
- **Shared Knowledge Base:**
  - Persistent vector database for storing successful solutions, reflections, and insights.
  - Agents query this knowledge base before new tasks to leverage prior experience.
- **Meta-Learning:**
  - System tracks and analyzes plan performance, adjusts heuristics for future planning.

### Phase 5: Output Specification & Performance Evaluation
- **Deliverables:**
  - Final research report (Markdown, with executive summary, methodology, findings, limitations, citations).
  - Data visualizations (PNG, SVG, HTML plots).
  - Version-controlled repository (code, data, models, logs).
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Qualitative: Accuracy, reliability, ethical compliance (via HITL review).
  - Quantitative: Goal completion rate, model performance, efficiency, cost, token usage.

### Phase 6: Meta-Reflection on Guiding Prompt
- **Prompt Analysis:**
  - Strengths: Clarity, hierarchical structure, context-richness, advanced concept emphasis.
  - Weaknesses: Implicit tooling requirements, lack of hard constraints.
  - Proposed improvements: Tool manifest, dynamic constraint injection, structured meta-reflection output.

## Operational Logic and Recommendations
- **Adopt hierarchical, dynamic planning with multi-level feedback and meta-learning.**
- **Enforce contextual security, granular permissions, and DLP for all data access.**
- **Mandate HITL checkpoints and bias/hallucination mitigation in all AI-driven research.**
- **Leverage shared knowledge base and meta-learning for continuous improvement.**
- **Require structured, cited, and reproducible deliverables with clear evaluation metrics.**

## Checklist Update Recommendation
- Mark Agent_s Role and Plan Generation_.md as reviewed and extracted in the master checklist.
- Ensure all operational logic, feedback mechanisms, and governance strategies are referenced in the knowledge base.
- Continue atomic review for the next file in the Research directory.
