# File Review Log: _Samples/Prompts/dndai-progress-70.txt

## Review Summary
- Contains a detailed monologue and meta-reflection on prompt engineering, agent bootstrapping, and the critical importance of explicit repository access in autonomous agent prompts.
- Actionable content includes: explicit directives for including the GitHub repository as a primary source, mandatory agent bootstrapping steps, and a comprehensive master research prompt template.

## Actionable Extracts
- Add the GitHub repository URL as a foundational document in all agent prompts.
- Mandate the agent's first action to clone the repository using a dedicated tool.
- Use a holistic, multi-source synthesis approach for all research and planning directives.
- Enforce principles of radical originality and emergent gameplay in all generative outputs.
- Require a modular, microservice-based architecture for the AI suite.
- Provide executable hardware configuration scripts for all target systems.
- Architect the agent's core workflow around a hierarchical task tree, reflective cycles, and strict instruction hierarchy.
- Integrate D&D rules and domain knowledge as a core requirement.
- Deliver a single, self-contained MasterPrompt.md as the agent ignition package.
- Include a comprehensive user onboarding and starter kit in the final deliverable.

## Status
- [x] Fully reviewed and actionable content extracted.

---

## Next Steps
- Synthesize these directives into blueprint and prompt template updates.
- Cross-reference with other prompt and research files for consistency.
- Log this review in the running improvement log.
