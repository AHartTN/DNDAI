# Blueprint: Atomic Agent Review and Extraction

## Purpose

A stepwise, auditable checklist for reviewing any file or artifact, ensuring atomic, granular extraction, operational logging, and continuous improvement based on the latest research and system requirements.

## Steps

1. Inventory the file and its context (including dependencies, architectural role, and operational mandates).
2. Read the file line by line, extracting actionable content, logic, ideas, and operational requirements.
3. Log all findings in a dedicated FileReviewLog in `_Autogenerated`, including machine-readable definitions of done (DoD) and QA/compliance checkpoints.
4. Mark the file as reviewed in the master checklist and update the workspace map and unified topics index.
5. Synthesize and compact extracted content for blueprints, process docs, and prompt templates, ensuring all new insights are reflected in modular, reusable formats.
6. Review outputs for completeness, cross-reference with current research blueprints, and iterate as needed for accuracy and coverage.
7. Log all actions, improvements, and lessons learned for traceability and future self-improvement.
8. Enforce security, resource etiquette, error handling, and completion criteria at every operational layer, as per latest architectural mandates.
9. Ensure all user-facing instructions and outputs are dynamically adapted to user context and environment.
10. Maintain a living, auditable record of operations, compliance, and self-correction.
