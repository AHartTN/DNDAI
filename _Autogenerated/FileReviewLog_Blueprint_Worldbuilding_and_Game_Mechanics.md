## Actionable Extracts & Operational Logic

### 1. World Structure
- Cosmology/planes (Prime, Feywild, Shadowfell, Elemental, Outer).
- Regions, kingdoms, maps (Ashvale, Blackmoor), lore, history, timelines.
- Factions, organizations, cultures, races, subraces, custom cultures.
- Sample region table for quick reference.

### 2. Core Mechanics
- Stats, skills, proficiencies; spell schools, class lists, archetypes.
- Backgrounds, features, advancement systems; variant/campaign mechanics.
- Sample stat block template for NPCs/monsters.

### 3. Encounter & Creature Design
- Monster roles/templates, random encounter tables by terrain.
- Boss/solo frameworks, advanced combat (legendary/lair actions).
- Monster customization: hybrids, mutations, enhancements, planar variants.
- Sample encounter hook for campaign use.

### 4. DM Tools
- Narration/pacing templates, improv/player agency tools, session management.
- Calculators, generators, planning sheets for encounters/loot.
- Sample session template for campaign structure.

## Operational Logic
- Modular, template-driven worldbuilding and mechanics for D&D campaigns.
- All sections provide reusable tables, templates, and hooks for rapid campaign prep.
