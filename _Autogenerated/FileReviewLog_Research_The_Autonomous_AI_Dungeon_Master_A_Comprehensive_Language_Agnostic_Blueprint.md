# File Review Log: Research/The Autonomous AI Dungeon Master_ A Comprehensive Language-Agnostic Blueprint.md

## Review Summary
- Outlines a comprehensive, language-agnostic blueprint for the D&D Dungeon Master AI, integrating edge autonomy, composable expertise, decentralized compute, agent self-governance, and psychological acuity.
- Actionable content includes: modular, multi-layered architecture, cognitive core, planning frameworks (ReAct, ToT, HTN), self-reflection, proactive improvement, multi-modal memory, self-evolving toolset, and robust security.

## Actionable Extracts
- Build the agent on a modular, language-agnostic, and multi-layered architecture.
- Implement a cognitive core with ReAct, ToT, and HTN planning.
- Integrate self-reflection, critique, and proactive improvement (BDI model).
- Use vector databases and knowledge graphs for memory and context.
- Enable dynamic tool wrapping and self-evolving capabilities.
- Enforce strict security, resource governance, and observability.
- Codify all operational logic in a MasterPrompt.md as the agent's constitutional blueprint.

## Status
- [x] Fully reviewed and actionable content extracted.

## Next Steps
- Synthesize these blueprints into operational and architectural documentation.
- Update the running improvement log and blueprint library.
