# Blueprint: Modular Agent Task Decomposition


## Purpose

A template for breaking down complex user requests and operational mandates into modular, auditable subtasks, with traceable outputs and integration of the latest research and system requirements.

## Steps

1. Parse the user request or operational mandate, identifying all subcomponents, dependencies, and architectural relationships.
2. Decompose the request into atomic, modular subtasks, ensuring each is independently testable, auditable, and aligned with current blueprints and operational logic.
3. Execute each subtask independently, logging outputs, decisions, and lessons learned in a dedicated improvement log.
4. Synthesize results and present a unified, auditable output, updating blueprints, process docs, and prompt templates as required.
5. Cross-reference all outputs with the latest research, security, and compliance requirements, iterating as needed for completeness and accuracy.
