# DNDAI Blueprint: Exhaustive Review and Extraction Process

## Purpose

A step-by-step operational blueprint for exhaustively reviewing every file and folder in the DNDAI workspace, extracting actionable content, enforcing security and compliance, and generating new blueprints, templates, and documentation as required by the latest research and system mandates.

## Steps

1. Recursively list every file and folder in the workspace, including all dependencies and architectural relationships.
2. For each file, perform a full, line-by-line review of its entire content, extracting actionable content, operational logic, and requirements.
3. Log the review status and findings for every file (including empty, binary, or non-text files) in a dedicated FileReviewLog in `_Autogenerated`, with machine-readable DoD and QA/compliance checkpoints.
4. Extract all actionable content, ideas, and relevant information line by line, ensuring security, resource etiquette, error handling, and completion criteria are enforced at every step.
5. Create new blueprints, prompt templates, scripts, or documentation as required, based solely on the reviewed content and current architectural mandates.
6. Summarize actionable patterns and operational logic for each new document, cross-referencing with the latest research and system blueprints.
7. Log all new documents, improvements, and lessons learned in a running improvement log for traceability and future self-improvement.
8. Periodically summarize and compact all extracted content for each file, folder, and category, updating the workspace map, unified topics index, and master checklist.
9. Update blueprints, prompts, and instructions with improved, modular, and reusable versions as new insights are gained.
10. Maintain a living, auditable record of all actions, summaries, and compactions for traceability, compliance, and continuous improvement.

## Notes

- Do not use any legacy indices, outlines, or cross-references to direct or filter this process.
- Ensure every file, including empty, binary, or non-text files, is logged and reviewed.
- Enforce security, resource etiquette, error handling, and completion criteria at every operational layer.
- Continue without interruption until all steps are complete and all actionable content is extracted and synthesized.
