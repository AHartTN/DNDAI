# File Review Log: Master-Prompt.md

## Actionable Extracts & Operational Logic

### 1. Objective & Scope

- MasterPrompt.md is a self-contained ignition package for a VS Code agent to autonomously build, configure, test, and deploy an AI Dungeon Master microservice suite.
- Synthesizes hardware inventories, foundational documents, and codebase for a holistic, autonomous build process.


### 2. Source Material & Corpus

- Hardware: HART-DESKTOP (Windows 11, i9, RTX 4060 Ti, 192GB RAM), HART-SERVER (Ubuntu, i7, GTX 1080 Ti, 128GB RAM), HART-ROUTER (OpenWrt), ARRIS S33v2 modem.
- Documents: GitHub repo, architectural/strategic goals, agentic engineering principles, world-building blueprint, full development dialogue.


### 3. Core Directives & Principles

- Radical originality, emergent gameplay, modular AI suite, optimal tech stack, and architecture.
- Executable hardware configuration plans for each component (scripts for Windows/Linux, OpenWrt configs).
- Agent must use a Custom Toolkit (GitRepositoryCloner, FileSystemAnalyzer) and operate in an isolated workspace.
- Hierarchical Task Tree, cognitive loop (Plan -> Act -> Evaluate -> Refine), RAG for grounding, strict instruction hierarchy.
- Machine-readable Definition of Done (DoD) for quality assurance.


### 4. Operational Logic

- Agent bootstraps by cloning the repo, isolating workspace, and following a hierarchical, self-correcting task plan.
- Integrates D&D rules for mechanical validity.
- Outputs a single, self-contained MasterPrompt.md with all instructions, constitution, task tree, blueprints, and DoD.
- Includes a user onboarding/starter kit with prompts, templates, and scripts.
