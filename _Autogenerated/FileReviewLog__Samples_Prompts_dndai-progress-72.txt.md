# File Review Log: _Samples/Prompts/dndai-progress-72.txt

## Review Summary
- Contains an exhaustive, operational research roadmap for building a self-building, fully autonomous D&D AI ecosystem.
- Actionable content includes: detailed blueprints for agent autonomy, continuous operation, distributed intelligence, agent orchestration, memory architecture, prompt engineering, modularity, observability, and quality assurance.

## Actionable Extracts
- Architect the agent for true autonomy, self-building, and continuous operation.
- Implement multi-agent orchestration, OODA/BIPA/HTN planning, and self-monitoring.
- Formalize all DM/player tasks as atomic API contracts and composite scripts.
- Build a multi-layered memory system (short-term, session, campaign, global knowledge base).
- Use vector stores and knowledge graphs for semantic retrieval and reasoning.
- Develop a robust plugin/extension system and public APIs for extensibility.
- Integrate advanced prompt engineering (CoT, ReAct, ToT), dynamic prompt management, and meta-prompting.
- Enforce constitutional AI, instruction hierarchy, and robust guardrails.
- Require metacognitive self-correction, reflexion, and self-documentation.
- Mandate RAG-based context retrieval and codebase awareness.
- Provide a unified prompting framework and master template for agent constitution and workflows.

## Status
- [x] Fully reviewed and actionable content extracted.

---

## Next Steps
- Synthesize these blueprints into operational process docs and prompt templates.
- Update the running improvement log and blueprint library.
