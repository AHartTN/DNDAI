## Actionable Extracts & Operational Logic

### 1. Project Vision & Ultimate Goal
- Engineer a highly autonomous, intelligent, and secure AI agent for the full spectrum of software engineering, administration, maintenance, and moderation tasks.
- Evolution from basic automation to a self-aware, prosumer-centric, edge-deployable, decentralized, and collaborative engineering entity.
- Mandate for non-intrusive operation ("no gaming impact"), resource awareness, and dynamic load balancing.

### 2. Strategic Imperatives (by Iteration)
- Velocity Acceleration, Quality/Reliability, Security-First, Operational Excellence, Edge Autonomy, Composable Expertise, Distributed Intelligence, Agent Self-Governance, Psychological Acuity, Autonomous Capability Expansion.
- Each imperative drives architectural and functional evolution, e.g., distributed compute fabric, modular microservices, self-correction, and proactive improvement.

### 3. Prosumer-Centric & Edge-Deployable Mandate
- Agent must run efficiently on specified home hardware (server, desktop) and eventually on edge devices (smartphones).
- Resource & Security Governor and check_host_load tool enforce non-intrusive, resource-aware operation.
- Advanced model compression, quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation for edge deployment.

### 4. Decentralized Compute Vision
- Decentralized, user-consented compute fabric for opportunistic resource utilization.
- Multi-layered secure execution: TEEs, WASM, federated tasks, encrypted comms, dynamic network topology mapping.
- Incentive frameworks and real-time network intelligence for practical viability.

### 5. Core Guiding Principles
- Verifiable & Actionable Outputs: All outputs must be empirically validated (tests, benchmarks, F1-scores, etc.).
- Layered Approach & Modular Design: Swappable components, microservices-style architecture, dependency injection.
- Security-First: Multi-layered, holistic security, self-governance, and automated audits.
- Comprehensive Error Handling: System-wide detection, diagnosis, self-correction, and proactive improvement.
- Explicit Completion Criteria: Machine-verifiable contracts (CCDL), internal and external task validation.
- Open-Ended Customization: Deep configurability, user-driven adaptation, and custom tool-wrapping.
- Rigorous Requirements Fulfillment: Internalized, programmatic enforcement of all requirements and constraints.
- Exemplary End-User Focused: Dynamic, empathetic, and dependency-aware user instructions.
- Deeply Environmentally Aware: Real-time, dynamic adaptation to OS, terminal, network, and resource state.

### 6. Architectural Components
- Cognitive Core: LLM orchestrator, adaptive planner, tool orchestrator, self-reflection, resource/security governor.
- Memory Systems: Hybrid vector DB + knowledge graph, multi-modal, high-throughput retrieval, strategic plan/user model subgraphs.
- Toolset: Extensible, dynamic tool generation (CLI/API wrapping), proactive dependency management, advanced troubleshooting.
- VS Code Extension Interface: Secure IPC, terminal automation, environment config, Copilot mediation.
- Decentralized Compute Fabric: User consent, secure execution, resource discovery, task partitioning, fault tolerance, incentives.

### 7. Capabilities & Features
- Edge autonomy, composable expertise, decentralized intelligence, senior engineering peer equivalence, agent self-governance.
- Automated enforcement of best practices, static analysis, self-reflective refactoring, multi-modal distributed execution.
- Plan as internalized knowledge graph, meta-cognitive plan adherence, self-correction, proactive operational improvement.

## Operational Logic
- All principles, imperatives, and architectural components are cross-referenced and enforced throughout the agent's design and operation.
- The Research folder is the highest-priority, canonical source for requirements, constraints, and architectural blueprints.
- All findings are empirically validated, machine-auditable, and drive continuous self-improvement.
