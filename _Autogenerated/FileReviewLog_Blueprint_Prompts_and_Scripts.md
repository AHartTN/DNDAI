## Actionable Extracts & Operational Logic

### 1. Campaign Prompts
- Campaign generation: genre, theme, party level, region → summary, factions, hooks.
- Worldbuilding: expand lore for region (history, NPCs, conflicts).
- Modular narrative: generate next event and DM notes from campaign state.

### 2. Encounter & Asset Prompts
- Encounter resolution: party actions, terrain → balanced encounter, stat blocks, loot.
- Image asset: Stable Diffusion prompt for NPC portrait (description, style, mood).
- NPC stat block: generate for archetype, motivation, gear.

### 3. Modular Script Stubs
- Campaign start: params → setting, NPCs, encounter, summary.
- Encounter: player action, terrain → encounter, stat blocks, loot, details.
- Asset generation: prompt, style guide → image, URL/metadata.

### 4. Instruction Templates
- Context management: use symbolic references, summarize every 5-10 steps.
- Transparency: brief explanation for major actions.
- User adaptation: detect/adapt to user interaction patterns.
- Human-in-the-loop: prompt for review/correction after analysis.
- Feedback: allow users to flag errors/request clarification.

## Operational Logic
- Modular, reusable prompt and script templates for campaign, encounter, asset, and documentation workflows.
- Instruction templates for context management, transparency, user adaptation, validation, and feedback.
