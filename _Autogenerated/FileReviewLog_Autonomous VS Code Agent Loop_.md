# File Review Log: Autonomous VS Code Agent Loop_.md

## Atomic Extraction of Actionable Content and Operational Logic

### Agentic System Principles
- **Paradigm Shift:** From reactive to proactive, stateful, self-improving agents with genuine agency for complex, long-term objectives in VS Code.
- **Architectural Spectrum:**
  - Reactive: Perception-action loop, no memory.
  - Deliberative: Maintains internal state, plans, and executes multi-step workflows.
  - Proactive: Anticipates needs, handles edge cases, resolves knowledge gaps autonomously.
- **Modular Architecture:** Essential for scalability, maintainability, and robust agentic systems.

### Core Architectural Pillars
- **Perception:** Workspace/document/code comprehension, environment awareness.
- **Planning:** Task decomposition, strategy formulation, progress tracking.
- **Action:** File system/API operations, tool use, communication, security.
- **Memory:** Working, episodic, semantic, and procedural memory for context retention and learning.

### State Management & Internal Documents
- **Memory Taxonomy:**
  - Working: Immediate focus/task list.
  - Episodic: Chronological log/status log.
  - Semantic: Structured, long-term knowledge base.
  - Procedural: Learned skills/action sequences.
- **Internal Documents:**
  - Status Log: Immutable, append-only episodic memory (timestamp, task_id, event_type, content).
  - Task List: Hierarchical, dynamic, tracks status, dependencies, and action history.
- **Persistence:** Use SQL/NoSQL for structured data, vector DBs for unstructured/semantic memory, hybrid search for retrieval.

### Planning & Task Decomposition
- **Planning Module:** Task decomposition (CoT, ToT, ReAct), structured, machine-readable plans (JSON, schema-based).
- **Hierarchical Task Tree:** Enables granular progress tracking, error isolation, and dependency management.

### Self-Improvement & Quality Assurance
- **Reflective Cycle:** Plan -> Act -> Reflect -> Refine until quality standard is met.
- **Self-Evaluation:** LLM-as-judge, error identification, performance analysis, transparent reasoning, self-correction.
- **Proactive Intelligence:** Edge case detection, knowledge gap resolution (semantic search, codebase analysis, external tools).

### Definition of Done (DoD)
- **Machine-Readable DoD:** Formal, version-controlled checklist (dod.json) for objective, automated QA.
- **Automated Verification:** Deterministic checks (builds/tests), LLM-based evaluation for subjective criteria.
- **Escape Condition:** Root task complete only after all sub-tasks pass DoD; agent exits loop only on verifiable "perfection."

### Implementation Blueprint
- **Frameworks:** LangGraph for runtime, Taskara/custom for task persistence, modular microservices, containerized deployment.
- **VS Code Integration:** Extension API for workspace/editor/terminal access, strict security and sandboxing.
- **Prompt Engineering:** System, planning, action, and reflection prompts for each cognitive function.
- **Production Infrastructure:** Scalability, observability, security, centralized logging, and monitoring.

## Checklist Update Recommendation
- Mark Autonomous VS Code Agent Loop_.md as reviewed and extracted in the master checklist.
- Ensure all agentic principles, memory/state management, planning, self-improvement, and DoD logic are referenced in the knowledge base.
- Continue atomic review for the next file in the Research directory.
