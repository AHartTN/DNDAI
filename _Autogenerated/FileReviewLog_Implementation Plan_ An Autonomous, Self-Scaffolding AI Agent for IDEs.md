# File Review Log: Implementation Plan_ An Autonomous, Self-Scaffolding AI Agent for IDEs.md

## Atomic Extraction of Actionable Content and Operational Logic

### Overview
- **Purpose:** Outlines a stepwise, modular implementation plan for building an autonomous, self-improving AI agent for IDEs (e.g., VS Code).
- **Scope:** Covers agent architecture, self-scaffolding, prompt engineering, memory, orchestration, and integration with developer workflows.

### Key Extracted Steps & Logic
- **Agent Bootstrapping:**
  - Minimal core agent with self-diagnostic and self-improvement routines.
  - Modular plugin/extension system for capabilities (file I/O, code analysis, prompt management, etc.).
- **Self-Scaffolding:**
  - Agent generates, reviews, and integrates its own code and configuration.
  - Uses prompt templates, code synthesis, and self-critique loops.
- **Prompt Engineering:**
  - Modular, reusable prompt templates for tasks (review, extraction, refactoring, etc.).
  - Chain-of-Thought, ReAct, and DoD-driven output validation.
- **Memory & Context:**
  - Hybrid memory (short/long-term, vector DB, file-based, session, etc.).
  - Context window management, summarization, and retrieval.
- **Orchestration & Autonomy:**
  - Task decomposition, planning, and execution via event-driven or graph-based workflows.
  - Self-correction, rollback, and audit trails.
- **IDE Integration:**
  - Secure, modular extension architecture.
  - File system, command palette, and UI integration.

### Operational Logic
- **Iterative Development:**
  - Agent iteratively improves itself, guided by a master checklist and DoD.
  - Each module is reviewed, tested, and refined in atomic steps.
- **Self-Assessment:**
  - Agent uses checklists, logs, and self-review to ensure completeness and correctness.

## Checklist Update Recommendation
- Mark Implementation Plan_ An Autonomous, Self-Scaffolding AI Agent for IDEs.md as reviewed and extracted in the master checklist.
- Ensure all implementation steps and operational logic are referenced in the knowledge base.
- Continue atomic review for the next file in the Research directory.
