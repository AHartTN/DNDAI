# DNDAI Blueprint: Systematic Batch Processing

## Purpose

A blueprint for processing all files in logical batches for efficiency, ensuring every line of every file is reviewed, actionable content is extracted, and all compliance, security, and operational mandates from the latest research are enforced.

## Steps

1. Divide the full file inventory into logical batches (by folder, type, size, or architectural dependency), ensuring all dependencies and relationships are mapped.
2. For each batch:
   - Review every file line by line, extracting actionable content, operational logic, and requirements.
   - Log all findings, actions, and compliance checkpoints in a dedicated improvement log.
   - Create new documents, templates, or scripts as required, based on current blueprints and operational mandates.
   - Mark each file as fully reviewed and processed in the master checklist, workspace map, and unified topics index.
   - Enforce security, resource etiquette, error handling, and completion criteria at every operational layer.
   - Cross-reference all outputs with the latest research and system blueprints, iterating as needed for completeness and accuracy.
3. Repeat until all files are processed and all actionable content is extracted and synthesized.

## Notes

- No file is skipped, regardless of type or content.
- Enforce security, compliance, and operational mandates at every step.
- Continue without interruption until all batches are complete and all actionable content is extracted and synthesized.
