# File Review Log: Research/VS Code Agent Enhancement_.md

## Review Summary
- Provides a comprehensive framework for advanced GitHub Copilot agent configuration, including environment setup, project constitution, prompt blueprints, and robust guardrails.
- Actionable content includes: hierarchical configuration (settings.json, copilot-instructions.md, .prompt.md), reasoning frameworks (CoT, ReAct, ToT), constitutional AI, instruction hierarchy, metacognitive prompting, and RAG-based context retrieval.

## Actionable Extracts
- Structure agent configuration in three layers: global (settings.json), project constitution (.github/copilot-instructions.md), and task blueprints (.prompt.md).
- Use Chain-of-Thought, ReAct, and Tree of Thoughts frameworks for all complex agent reasoning.
- Enforce constitutional AI and strict instruction hierarchy to prevent prompt injection and ensure safety.
- Mandate metacognitive prompting and reflexion for self-correction and transparency.
- Require RAG-based context retrieval and codebase awareness for all code generation.
- Provide a master template for copilot-instructions.md and example .prompt.md blueprints.

## Status
- [x] Fully reviewed and actionable content extracted.

---

## Next Steps
- Update agent configuration blueprints and prompt templates.
- Log this review in the running improvement log.
