# File Review Log: Research/Strategic Plan for a Robust and Highly Performant AI Dungeon Master.md

## Review Summary
- Provides a step-by-step plan for a robust, performant AI Dungeon Master, focusing on T-SQL data architecture, Llama 4/Stable Diffusion integration, microservices, and hardware constraints.
- Actionable content includes: normalized/denormalized T-SQL schema, hybrid vector search, microservices (C#/Python), phased development, and critical hardware recommendations.

## Actionable Extracts
- Design a normalized T-SQL schema for campaign memory, lore, and world data.
- Use hybrid vector search (external vector DB + T-SQL) for scalable RAG.
- Orchestrate APIs via C# ASP.NET Core and Python microservices for AI inference.
- Implement phased development, rigorous testing, and comprehensive monitoring.
- Prioritize disk I/O monitoring and hardware upgrades for Llama 4 performance.
- Integrate content moderation and safety layers for all AI outputs.

## Status
- [x] Fully reviewed and actionable content extracted.

---

## Next Steps
- Integrate these architectural and operational recommendations into the system blueprint.
- Log this review in the running improvement log.
