# File Review Log: DNDAI MasterPrompt Generation Directive_.md

## Actionable Extracts & Findings
- **MasterPrompt.md:** Genesis block for autonomous DNDAI build; must be self-contained, executable, and provide all directives for agent operation.
- **Core Principles:** Level 4 autonomy, self-building, continuous operation, originality, human-like interaction, resilience, security.
- **Corpus:** Agent must use only the provided research corpus; no external data.
- **Agent Toolkit:** Custom tools for Git, filesystem, DB, network, containers, models, monitoring, testing, and APIs.
- **Reasoning Frameworks:** ReAct, Tree of Thoughts, Chain-of-Symbol, prompt chaining, compression, self-evaluation, and error detection.
- **Git Workflow:** Strict version control, CI/CD, and auditability for agent and product code.
- **Deliverables:** MasterPrompt.md with explicit structure, user starter kit, DoD, guardrails, internal monologue, and progress reporting.

## Operational Logic
- Generate a fully self-contained MasterPrompt.md as the ignition package for autonomous build.
- Enforce strict adherence to core principles, auditability, and safety protocols.
- Use advanced agentic reasoning and continuous self-improvement.

## Status
Fully reviewed and actionable content extracted. See above for operational logic and implementation priorities.
