# File Review Log: Agent_s Role and Plan Generation_.md

## Atomic, Granular Extraction and Operational Logic

### 1. Hierarchical Planning & Dynamic Adaptation
- **Hierarchical Decomposition:** Major objectives broken into granular sub-tasks, enabling modular, feedback-driven execution by a multi-agent system (Expert Planner, Gemini sub-planner, execution agent).
- **Dynamic Scope & Success Metrics:** Each sub-task has explicit deliverables and quantifiable metrics, enabling systematic progress tracking and agent self-evaluation.
- **Dynamic Adaptation:** Goal Re-evaluation Triggers and Reflexion paradigm for self-correction, replanning, and meta-learning. System adapts to unexpected results and learns from failures, updating future plans and heuristics.

### 2. Data Access, Security, and Governance
- **Contextual Security Model:** Just-in-time, least-privilege access using OAuth 2.0 + OIDC, with granular scope management and dynamic grant type selection.
- **Data Governance:** Automated data classification, DLP, lineage tracking, and compliance via Microsoft Purview. Policies enforce secure, auditable, and ethical data use.
- **Schema Validation:** Proactive schema/version checks before data processing, with agentic adaptation to breaking changes.

### 3. Analytical Methodology & Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
- **AI Techniques:** NLP for literature review, ML for pattern discovery, CV/OCR for unstructured data, cross-modal synthesis for holistic insights.
- **HITL Protocol:** Mandatory human validation checkpoints at key workflow stages (data, model, synthesis, final report) for accuracy, reliability, and ethical compliance.
- **Bias & Hallucination Mitigation:** Source citation, cross-verification, bias analysis, and explicit limitations section in all outputs.

### 4. Iterative Refinement, Reflexion, and Meta-Learning
- **Multi-Level Feedback Loops:** Observations and self-reflections propagate up the agent hierarchy, enabling tactical and strategic replanning.
- **ReAct & Reflexion Paradigms:** Explicit thought-action-observation loops and verbal reinforcement learning for robust, auditable, and adaptive agent behavior.
- **Shared Knowledge Base:** Persistent vector DB for storing and retrieving past solutions, failures, and validated insights.
- **Meta-Learning:** Systematic analysis of plan outcomes to refine future planning heuristics and resource allocation.

### 5. Output Specification & Evaluation
- **Deliverables:** Markdown research report, data visualizations, version-controlled repo with code, data, models, and reasoning traces.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Qualitative (accuracy, reliability, ethics) and quantitative (goal completion, model performance, cost, efficiency) tracked and reported.
- **Meta-Reflection:** Critical analysis of prompt efficacy, strengths, weaknesses, and structured improvement proposals for future prompt engineering.

## Operational Logic Extracted
- All hierarchical planning, dynamic adaptation, and agentic feedback mechanisms are to be encoded as machine-readable, testable logic in the agent system.
- Contextual security, data governance, and schema validation must be enforced at every data access and processing layer.
- HITL, bias mitigation, and cross-modal analysis are required for all analytical workflows.
- Reflexion, ReAct, and meta-learning must be implemented for continuous improvement and robust, adaptive planning.
- All deliverables and evaluation metrics must be tracked, versioned, and auditable.
