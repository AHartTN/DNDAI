# File Review Log: Research/Agent_s Role and Plan Generation_.md

## Atomic, Granular Extraction

### Phase 1: Hierarchical Planning & Dynamic Adaptation
- **Hierarchical Decomposition:** Breaks high-level research goals into a tree of objectives and granular sub-tasks, enabling modular, feedback-driven execution.
- **Dynamic Scope:** Objectives and strategies evolve as new information is discovered; plan adapts via "Goal Re-evaluation Trigger" when outcomes deviate from metrics.
- **Self-Reflection & Meta-Learning:** Reflexion paradigm for structured self-reflection, upward propagation of failures, replanning, and meta-strategy updates for future plans.

### Phase 2: Data Access & Governance
- **Contextual Security:** Dynamic, just-in-time, least-privilege access; agent as a digital entity with verifiable identity and auditable actions.
- **Authentication/Authorization:** OAuth 2.0 (client credentials, auth code with PKCE), OpenID Connect, granular scope management for APIs.
- **Data Governance:** Automated classification (Microsoft Purview), DLP policies, lineage tracking, policy enforcement for sensitive data, auditability.
- **Schema Validation:** Proactive schema/version checks before data processing; triggers adaptation or human intervention on breaking changes.

### Phase 3: AI-Driven Analysis & Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
- **NLP, ML, CV/OCR:** Modular use of AI for literature review, structured data analysis, and document parsing.
- **Cross-Modal Analysis:** Synthesizes insights from multiple data types for holistic vulnerability assessment.
- **HITL Protocol:** Mandatory checkpoints for human validation at key stages (data, model, synthesis, final report); hybrid review model for quality and trust.
- **Bias & Hallucination Mitigation:** Grounding, fact-checking, provenance analysis, explicit limitations section, human oversight as final safeguard.

### Phase 4: Iterative Refinement & System Feedback
- **Multi-Level Feedback:** Observations and self-reflections propagate up agent hierarchy; strategic feedback refines future plans.
- **ReAct & Reflexion:** Explicit thought-action-observation loops for transparency and dynamic adjustment; verbal reinforcement learning for persistent improvement.
- **Shared Knowledge Base:** Persistent vector DB for storing solutions, reflections, and validated insights; meta-learning for planning optimization.

### Phase 5: Output & Evaluation
- **Deliverables:** Markdown report, data visualizations, version-controlled repo, full logs for reproducibility.
- **Metrics:** Qualitative (accuracy, ethics, human corrections), quantitative (goal completion, model performance, cost, efficiency).

### Phase 6: Meta-Reflection on Prompting
- **Prompt Analysis:** Strengths (clarity, context, advanced concepts), areas for improvement (explicit tool manifest, hard constraints, structured feedback).
- **Proposed Improvements:** Tool manifest, dynamic constraint injection, formalized meta-reflection for closed-loop prompt optimization.

## Operational Logic & Actionable Content
- All phases are to be encoded as modular, auditable, and self-improving agent workflows.
- Dynamic adaptation, contextual security, and HITL checkpoints are mandatory in all research agent plans.
- Reflexion/meta-learning, schema validation, and persistent knowledge base are required for robust, evolving research automation.
- All outputs must be reproducible, version-controlled, and fully auditable.
