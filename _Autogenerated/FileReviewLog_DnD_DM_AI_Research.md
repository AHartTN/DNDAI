# File Review Log: D&D DM AI Research_.md

## Actionable Extracts & Findings
- **Language-Agnostic Design:** Core logic, memory, and operational components are decoupled from specific natural languages.
- **Modular Architecture:** Layered, swappable components (LLMs, tools, memory backends) for adaptability and extensibility.
- **Security & Resource Management:** Zero Trust, sandboxing, dynamic self-throttling, and resource governors are required for safe, efficient operation.
- **Error Handling:** Robust, system-wide error detection, diagnosis, and autonomous resolution, with a knowledge graph taxonomy of error types.
- **Completion Criteria:** Machine-verifiable contracts (YAML/JSON) for all tasks, with explicit validation and self-management.
- **Customization:** All behaviors and parameters must be externally configurable (YAML/JSON), supporting deep personalization.
- **Environmental Awareness:** Real-time system and network awareness for adaptive orchestration.

## Operational Logic
- Enforce language-agnostic, modular design for all core systems.
- Integrate robust security, error handling, and completion validation.
- Support deep customization and environmental adaptation.

## Status
Fully reviewed and actionable content extracted. See above for operational logic and implementation priorities.
