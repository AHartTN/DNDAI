# File Review Log: Agent Optimization Research Plan_.md

## Review Status
- File: Research/Agent Optimization Research Plan_.md
- Status: Reviewed (lines 1-60 of 540)
- Type: Markdown, Research/Blueprint

## Actionable Content Extracted (lines 1-60)
- Agentic reasoning frameworks (ReAct, Tree of Thoughts) are essential for robust, multi-step task execution in VS Code Copilot.
- ReAct: Interleaves thought-action-observation for feedback-driven planning and execution.
- Tree of Thoughts: Enables exploration of multiple solution paths, using state evaluation and search algorithms for complex planning.
- Token efficiency is critical: Symbolic linking, prompt chaining, and prompt compression reduce context size and improve reliability.
- Symbolic file references and chaining enable long, complex task execution without exceeding LLM context limits.

## Patterns/Operational Logic
- Structured, feedback-driven reasoning loops (ReAct, ToT).
- Token-efficient context management (symbolic linking, chaining, compression).
- Modular, stepwise prompt orchestration for reliability and debuggability.

## Next Steps
- Continue line-by-line review for remaining 480 lines.
- Extract further actionable content, patterns, and operational logic.
- Log findings and update summary/compaction as review progresses.
