## Operational Logic & Actionable Content
- All mandates, principles, and architectural elements are to be encoded as machine-readable, testable, and auditable logic in the agent's core.
- Resource etiquette, security, error handling, and completion criteria are to be enforced at every operational layer.
- All user-facing instructions must be dynamically adapted to user context and environment.
- The agent must continuously self-improve, self-correct, and maintain a living, auditable record of its own operations and compliance.
