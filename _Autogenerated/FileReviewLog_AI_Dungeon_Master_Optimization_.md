# File Review Log: AI Dungeon Master Optimization_.md

## Atomic, Granular Extraction and Operational Logic

### 1. Data Architecture & Management
- **Data Categories:** Campaign (real-time), History (immutable), Lore (static/semistatic), AI-generated, User-generated.
- **Deduplication:** Content hashing, versioning, unique constraints to ensure data integrity and optimize storage.
- **Volume Handling:** Partitioning, sharding, and disk monitoring for large, growing datasets.

### 2. T-SQL Schema & Retrieval
- **Core Entities:** Campaigns, Sessions, Characters, Locations, Items, LoreEntries, Events, CharacterStates, Relationships, VectorEmbeddings.
- **Data Types:** NVARCHAR(MAX) for text, JSON for semi-structured, VARBINARY(MAX) for vectors, DATETIME2, BIT.
- **Normalization/Denormalization:** Normalized for integrity, denormalized/materialized views for performance-critical retrieval.
- **Indexing:** Clustered/non-clustered, full-text, JSON indexes; hybrid vector search via external DB for semantic search.
- **Schema Evolution:** Migrations, soft deletes, versioning/audit tables.

### 3. Context Retrieval & RAG
- **Stored Procedures/Views:** For common, performance-critical retrieval.
- **Targeted Retrieval:** Only most relevant context for AI, pre-processing/summarization to fit model context windows.
- **RAG Pipeline:** Hybrid vector search (external DB), context augmentation, prompt construction for LLMs.
- **Temporal Tables:** For historical context reconstruction.

### 4. AI Model Integration & Optimization
- **Hardware Constraints:** GTX 1080 Ti sufficient for Stable Diffusion, not for large Llama 4 models; cloud/hybrid recommended for full performance.
- **Quantization:** FP8, INT4, block-wise, dynamic/static; benefits depend on hardware tensor core support.
- **Parallelism:** MoE model parallelism, data parallelism, efficient attention (iRoPE), pruning.
- **Content Moderation:** Llama-Guard, prompt guard models for safety; audit logs for moderation.

### 5. API & Cross-Language Integration
- **C# ASP.NET Core APIs:** Repository, Unit of Work, Dependency Injection, async/await, Entity Framework Core.
- **Microservices:** C# for API/data, Python for AI, TypeScript for frontend; standardized API contracts, JSON/Protobuf serialization.
- **Database Access:** Read-only endpoints or direct DB access for Python AI services.

### 6. Performance, Scalability, and Monitoring
- **Query Optimization:** Execution plan analysis, index design, join optimization, anti-pattern avoidance.
- **Partitioning/Sharding:** For large tables and extreme scalability.
- **Connection Pooling/Transactions:** Efficient resource use, explicit transaction management, isolation levels.
- **High Availability:** AlwaysOn, backups, point-in-time restore, monitoring (sysstat/iostat), alerting.

### 7. Semantic Search & RAG
- **Vector Embeddings:** VARBINARY(MAX) in T-SQL, hybrid with external vector DB for ANN search.
- **RAG:** Query embedding, vector search, context retrieval, prompt augmentation, LLM inference.

### 8. Implementation & Testing
- **Phased Approach:** Core DB/API, basic AI, semantic search/RAG, advanced Llama, refinement/scaling.
- **Testing:** Unit, integration, performance, AI evaluation, UAT.
- **Maintenance:** Monitoring, index maintenance, alerting, CI/CD.

### 9. Recommendations
- **Immediate:** Use Stable Diffusion locally, install sysstat for monitoring, hybrid semantic search.
- **Upgrade:** Invest in H100/A100 GPUs or migrate to cloud for large Llama models.
- **Future:** Model-agnostic design, multi-modality, RLHF, real-time analytics.

## Operational Logic Extracted
- All data, schema, and retrieval logic must be machine-readable, testable, and versioned.
- Hybrid semantic search and RAG are required for performant, context-rich AI.
- Hardware constraints and optimization strategies must be enforced at deployment.
- Microservices and cross-language contracts are mandatory for extensibility.
- Monitoring, alerting, and phased testing are required for reliability and scalability.
