# File Review Log: DNDAI Ecosystem Build Plan Genesis_.md

## Actionable Extracts & Findings
- **Master Plan:** Factual, executable build plan for a self-building, fully autonomous D&D AI ecosystem.
- **Agent Constitution:** Core principles (autonomy, meta-programming, continuous operation, resilience, security, originality, human-like interaction) are hard constraints.
- **Methodology:** Agent must use ReAct, Tree of Thoughts, and metacognitive self-correction in its own build process.
- **Toolset:** Pre-configured environment with VS Code, Git, DVC, MCP, Google Workspace, Mermaid.js.
- **Task Tree:** Hierarchical, stepwise execution of architecture, microservices, data management, hybrid RAG, CI/CD, and documentation.
- **Microservice Architecture:** Modular services (narrative, rules, state, player interaction, lore) with Docker, FastAPI, and robust orchestration.
- **Memory:** Hybrid RAG with knowledge graph and vector search for D&D knowledge.

## Operational Logic
- Execute all build steps in strict sequence, using agentic reasoning frameworks.
- Maintain strict separation of outputs, versioning, and audit logs.
- Prioritize robust, modular, and self-correcting architecture.

## Status
Fully reviewed and actionable content extracted. See above for operational logic and implementation priorities.
