# File Review Log: Iteration Four_ Agent Development Plan_.md

## Atomic Extraction of Actionable Content and Operational Logic

### Overview
- **Purpose:** Details the fourth iteration of the agent development plan, focusing on incremental improvements, modularization, and enhanced autonomy.
- **Scope:** Covers architecture, prompt engineering, memory, orchestration, and self-improvement cycles.

### Key Extracted Steps & Logic
- **Incremental Development:**
  - Iterative, atomic improvements to agent modules.
  - Continuous integration of new features and refinements.
- **Modular Architecture:**
  - Separation of concerns (prompt management, memory, orchestration, etc.).
  - Plug-and-play modules for extensibility.
- **Prompt Engineering:**
  - Enhanced templates, self-reflection, and deterministic output.
  - DoD-driven validation and self-correction.
- **Memory & Context:**
  - Improved context windowing, summarization, and retrieval.
  - Hybrid memory (short/long-term, vector DB, file-based, etc.).
- **Orchestration & Autonomy:**
  - Task decomposition, planning, and execution via event-driven or graph-based workflows.
  - Self-correction, rollback, and audit trails.

### Operational Logic
- **Iterative Self-Improvement:**
  - Agent uses checklists, logs, and self-review to ensure completeness and correctness.
  - Each module is reviewed, tested, and refined in atomic steps.

## Checklist Update Recommendation
- Mark Iteration Four_ Agent Development Plan_.md as reviewed and extracted in the master checklist.
- Ensure all iterative development steps and operational logic are referenced in the knowledge base.
- Continue atomic review for the next file in the Research directory.
