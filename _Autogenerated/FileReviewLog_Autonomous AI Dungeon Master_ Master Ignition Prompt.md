# File Review Log: Autonomous AI Dungeon Master_ Master Ignition Prompt.md

## Atomic Extraction of Actionable Content and Operational Logic

### Master Ignition Protocol
- **Agent Identity:** Build-agent operating in VS Code, bootstrapped by this document as "genetic code."
- **Objective:** Build, configure, test, and deploy a suite of AI microservices for a fully autonomous AI Dungeon Master.
- **System Initialization:**
  - Parse this document to load: Agent's Constitution, Hierarchical Task Tree (HTT), Task Blueprint Library, Definition of Done (DoD).
  - Activate layered cognitive loop (HTT traversal + Reflective Cycle) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for grounding.
  - Create isolated `.agent_workspace/` directory for all operations.
  - Begin by cloning https://github.com/AHartTN/DNDAI into workspace.

### Immutable Operational Principles (Agent's Constitution)
- **Isolation:** All modifications/commands restricted to `.agent_workspace/`.
- **Grounding:** All actions must be context-grounded via RAG from code, docs, and this prompt.
- **Verifiability:** No task is complete without machine-verifiable evaluation (tests, builds, API responses).
- **OGL Adherence:** All code/content must comply with OGL v1.0a; no "Product Identity" usage.
- **Resilience:** On failure, initiate Reflective Cycle (Plan -> Act -> Evaluate -> Refine) at least 5 times before human handoff.
- **Discovery:** Analyze the cloned repo before generating/modifying assets; adapt plan to findings.

### Hierarchical Task Tree (HTT) - Project Plan
- **Project Inception:**
  - Create workspace, clone repo, analyze source, generate summary, verify file existence.
  - Reconcile analysis with master plan, propose migration/refactoring if needed.
  - Index all source files and prompt into RAG vector store.
- **Infrastructure Provisioning:** Generate PowerShell, Bash, and UCI scripts for desktop, server, and router.
- **Backend Development:** Scaffold microservice directories, ingest SRD data, define DB schema, implement microservices (FastAPI, Docker, tests).
- **Containerization & Deployment:** Generate docker-compose, build and deploy stack.
- **Finalization:** Run end-to-end tests, generate onboarding kit, verify DoD, report completion.

### Task Blueprint Library
- **Reusable Prompt Templates:**
  - FastAPI CRUD generator
  - Multi-stage Dockerfile generator
  - Pytest suite generator
- **Strict adherence to OGL and quality standards.**

### Definition of Done (DoD)
- **Machine-verifiable checklist:**
  - Infrastructure scripts exist
  - All microservices build as Docker containers
  - All containers running on server
  - >90% test coverage
  - Player-Interaction-API accessible (200 OK)
  - Onboarding kit archived
  - Source analysis summary exists

## Checklist Update Recommendation
- Mark Autonomous AI Dungeon Master_ Master Ignition Prompt.md as reviewed and extracted in the master checklist.
- Ensure all operational principles, task blueprints, and DoD are referenced in the knowledge base.
- Continue atomic review for the next file in the Research directory.
