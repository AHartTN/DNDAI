# File Review Log: Blueprint_Exhaustive_Review_and_Extraction.md

## Actionable Extracts & Operational Logic

### 1. Purpose
- Blueprint for exhaustively reviewing every file/folder in the workspace.
- Extract actionable content and generate new docs as required.

### 2. Stepwise Process
1. Recursively list all files/folders.
2. Full, line-by-line review of each file.
3. Log review status/findings for every file (including empty/binary).
4. Extract actionable content/ideas line by line.
5. Create new blueprints, templates, scripts, or docs as needed from reviewed content.
6. Summarize actionable patterns/logic for each new doc.
7. Log all new docs/improvements in a running improvement log.
8. Periodically summarize/compact extracted content for each file/folder/category.
9. Update blueprints/prompts/instructions with improved versions as new insights are gained.
10. Maintain a running log of summaries/compactions for traceability.

### 3. Notes
- No legacy indices/outlines/cross-references to direct/filter the process.
- Every file (including empty/binary) must be logged and reviewed.
- Continue without interruption until all steps are complete.

## Operational Logic
- Atomic, exhaustive, and traceable review and extraction process for the entire workspace.
- All findings, improvements, and new docs are logged and summarized for traceability.
