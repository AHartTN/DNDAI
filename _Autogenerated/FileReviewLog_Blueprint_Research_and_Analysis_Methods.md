## Actionable Extracts & Operational Logic

### 1. Human-Centered AI (HCAI) Principles
- Augment, not replace, human abilities; balance automation/user control; adapt to user trust/needs/feedback.

### 2. Mixed Methods & Thematic Analysis
- Combine deductive/inductive coding; use thematic analysis for recurring concepts/patterns; document/update coding schemes.
- Sample coding scheme table provided (TRUST, SKEPTICISM, ADAPTATION, ERROR).

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop Validation
- AI for initial coding/summarization; human review for nuance/final decisions; user feedback/correction mechanisms.
- Analysis workflow: AI codes → human reviews/refines → final report with both inputs.

### 4. Interaction Pattern Recognition
- Identify/adapt to user interaction patterns (AI-first, AI-follow, request-driven, dialogic, delegation).
- Avoid over-reliance/cognitive overload; support iterative, feedback-driven improvement.
- Pattern checklist provided.

### 5. Transparency, Explainability, Ethics
- Provide clear/context-aware reasoning; respect privacy, avoid bias, ensure transparency.
- Avoid excessive automation/human control; ethical checklist for privacy, bias, explanations, human override.

## Operational Logic
- Human-centered, mixed-methods, and ethically grounded research/analysis for AI systems.
- Human-in-the-loop validation, pattern recognition, and transparency are core.
- All methods/checklists are documented and iteratively improved.
