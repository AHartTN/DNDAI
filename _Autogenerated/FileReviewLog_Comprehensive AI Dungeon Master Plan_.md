# File Review Log: Comprehensive AI Dungeon Master Plan_.md

## Atomic Extraction of Actionable Content and Operational Logic

### Project Charter & Vision
- **Objective:** Engineer an autonomous agent to serve as a D&D Dungeon Master (DM) with narrative creativity, rules mastery, adaptability, and campaign coherence.
- **MasterPrompt.md:** Serves as the constitutional blueprintâ€”codifies persona, operational logic, ethics, cognitive process, and system interface.
- **Clean Slate Mandate:** Due to inaccessible prior documentation, the plan mandates a first-principles, version-controlled, and resilient documentation framework.

### Multi-Layered Cognitive Architecture
- **Strategic Layer:** Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) for campaign/narrative planning; decomposes high-level goals into executable sub-tasks.
- **Tactical Layer:** Tree of Thoughts (ToT) for dynamic, multi-branch reasoning and creative improvisation; simulates multiple DM archetypes for decision quality.
- **Operational Loop:** Plan-Act-Evaluate-Refine (PAER) cycle for continuous self-improvement; every action is critiqued and refined.
- **Nested Loops:** HTN (slow/session), Scene Plan (medium), ToT (fast/turn), PAER (high-frequency/action).

### World Engine: Knowledge Representation & Grounding
- **RAG Pipeline:** Ingests D&D 5e SRD, chunks, embeds, and indexes for semantic retrieval; grounds LLM outputs in authoritative source material.
- **Knowledge Graph (KG):** Formal, structured world model (Neo4j) for multi-hop queries and rule/lore reasoning.
- **Vector DB:** Qdrant recommended for high-performance, metadata-filtered semantic search.
- **Symbiotic RAG+KG:** KG resolves structured relationships; RAG provides rich descriptive context for responses.

### Agent Constitution & Instruction Hierarchy
- **Core Principles:** Player agency, narrative coherence, SRD adherence, fairness, safety/content appropriateness.
- **Instruction Hierarchy:** Constitution > Developer Directives > Grounded Facts > World State > Player Input; enforced for conflict resolution and prompt injection defense.

### Infrastructure & Implementation
- **Hardware:** Distributed across HART-SERVER (inference), HART-DESKTOP (dev/db), OpenWrt router (networking).
- **Containerization:** Podman for rootless, secure, daemonless deployment; FastAPI for async microservices.
- **Persistence:** Neo4j (KG), MongoDB (game state), Qdrant (vector DB).

### Data Ingestion & ETL
- **API Extraction:** D&D 5e API for structured data; web scraping for narrative/lore.
- **ETL Pipeline:** Python-based, transforms and loads data into KG and vector DB.

### MasterPrompt.md Synthesis Protocol
- **Hierarchical, modular prompt structure:** Constitution, persona, cognitive process, tool usage, instruction hierarchy.
- **Explicit module mapping:** Each module corresponds to a core system component; dynamic assembly at runtime.

### Evaluation & Iteration
- **Automated Suite:** Rule adherence, task completion, constitutional adherence tests.
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Playtesting, structured feedback, iterative improvement.

## Checklist Update Recommendation
- Mark Comprehensive AI Dungeon Master Plan_.md as reviewed and extracted in the master checklist.
- Ensure all cognitive architecture, world engine, constitution, instruction hierarchy, infrastructure, and evaluation logic are referenced in the knowledge base.
- Continue atomic review for the next file in the Research directory.
