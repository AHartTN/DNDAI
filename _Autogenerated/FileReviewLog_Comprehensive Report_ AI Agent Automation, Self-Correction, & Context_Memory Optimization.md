# File Review Log: Comprehensive Report_ AI Agent Automation, Self-Correction, & Context_Memory Optimization.md

## Atomic Extraction of Actionable Content and Operational Logic

### Agent Automation & Orchestration
- **Multi-Agent Frameworks:** LangGraph (graph-based, cyclic, persistent memory), AutoGPT/Taskara (autonomous planning, persistent task DB), custom hybrid (LangGraph orchestration + Taskara persistence).
- **Workflow Patterns:** Saga (distributed transactions, compensating rollback), event-driven messaging (Kafka, RabbitMQ), CQRS (separate read/write models).
- **Autonomy Spectrum:** Levels 1–5, from simple processor to fully autonomous agent; higher autonomy increases efficiency and risk, requiring careful oversight.

### Self-Correction & Reflective Loops
- **Prompt Engineering:** Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), ReAct, structured JSON for deterministic, reliable outputs.
- **Generator–Critic Pattern:** Generator produces, critic evaluates, loop continues until Definition of Done (DoD) is met.
- **Self-Refinement Cycles:** Plan, act, self-critique, refine until all DoD checks pass.
- **Metrics & Observability:** Task completion time, revision count, user intervention rate, LLM confidence scores.
- **Proactive Knowledge-Gap Detection:** Uncertainty quantification, active learning, formal verification, executable specifications, agentic self-validation, compliance monitoring.

### Context & Memory Management
- **Memory Taxonomy:** Working (short-term), episodic (mid-term), semantic (long-term), procedural (skills/workflows).
- **Context Window Strategies:** Chunking, sliding window, summarization, attention-based pruning.
- **Hybrid & Hierarchical Retrieval:** Vector DB + metadata filters, hierarchical task tree, RAG for domain-specific knowledge.
- **Dynamic Budgeting & Pruning:** Token budgets for planning/execution/review, attention-score pruning, layer-wise KV cache allocation.
- **Persistence:** Polyglot (SQL for structured, NoSQL for unstructured, Redis for cache/session, vector DB for embeddings, Neo4j for KG, MLflow/DVC for versioning).

### Advanced Memory Architectures
- **External Episodic Controllers:** For experiential learning and self-reflection.
- **Neuromorphic/Neural-Symbolic Fusion:** For advanced, adaptive memory.
- **Tamper-Proof/Immutable Stores:** For audit trails and trust.

### Performance, Reliability, Governance
- **Hardware/Infra:** Docker, Kubernetes, observability, CI/CD, telemetry, memory-leak prevention.
- **Security & Trust:** Memory poisoning defenses, audit trails, versioning, machine-readable DoD.

### VS Code AI Agents: Configuration & Operation
- **Extension Architecture:** Secure, modular, agent definition locations, precedence/merging logic, file schema, variable resolution, execution flow, config comparison.

## Checklist Update Recommendation
- Mark Comprehensive Report_ AI Agent Automation, Self-Correction, & Context_Memory Optimization.md as reviewed and extracted in the master checklist.
- Ensure all orchestration, self-correction, memory, persistence, and VS Code agent configuration logic are referenced in the knowledge base.
- Continue atomic review for the next file in the Research directory.
