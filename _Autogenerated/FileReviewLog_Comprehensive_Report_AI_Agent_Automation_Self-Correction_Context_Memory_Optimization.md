# File Review Log: Comprehensive Report_ AI Agent Automation, Self-Correction, & Context_Memory Optimization

## Actionable Extracts & Findings
- **Agent Automation & Orchestration:** Multi-agent frameworks (LangGraph, AutoGPT, Taskara) and workflow patterns (Saga, event-driven messaging, CQRS) are essential for robust orchestration and error handling.
- **Agent Autonomy Spectrum:** Five levels of autonomy, with increasing risk and capability, from simple processors to fully autonomous agents. Each level requires specific architectural safeguards.
- **Self-Correction & Reflective Loops:** Techniques like Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thought, ReAct, and structured JSON prompting are critical for advanced reasoning, error detection, and reliable output.
- **Metrics & Observability:** Task completion time, revision count, user intervention rate, and LLM confidence scores are key metrics for agent self-improvement.
- **Knowledge-Gap Detection:** Proactive mechanisms (uncertainty quantification, active learning, formal verification) are needed for robust, trustworthy AI.
- **Code Patterns:** Includes code snippets for multi-agent orchestration, prompt engineering, reflective QA, and active learning.

## Operational Logic
- Implement multi-agent orchestration with robust error handling and rollback (Saga pattern).
- Integrate advanced prompt engineering and self-correction cycles for all generative tasks.
- Establish comprehensive observability and self-improvement metrics.
- Use hybrid memory architectures (vector, graph, transactional DB) for context and knowledge management.

## Status
Fully reviewed and actionable content extracted. See above for operational logic and implementation priorities.
