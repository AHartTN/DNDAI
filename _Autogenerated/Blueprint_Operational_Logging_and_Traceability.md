# Blueprint: Operational Logging and Traceability

## Purpose

A structure for maintaining detailed, timestamped logs of actions, decisions, improvements, and compliance, supporting auditability, debugging, and continuous self-improvement based on the latest research and operational mandates.

## Structure

- Timestamped log entries for every action, decision, and compliance checkpoint
- Reasoning and context for each step, including references to operational mandates and architectural requirements
- Links to related outputs, files, logs, and machine-readable definitions of done (DoD)
- Summary of lessons learned, improvements, and self-corrections, cross-referenced with the latest research and system blueprints
- Dedicated section for security, resource etiquette, error handling, and completion criteria enforcement
