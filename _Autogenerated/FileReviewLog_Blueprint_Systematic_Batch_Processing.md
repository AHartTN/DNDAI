# File Review Log: Blueprint_Systematic_Batch_Processing.md

## Actionable Extracts & Operational Logic

### 1. Purpose
- Blueprint for processing all files in logical batches for efficiency.
- Every line of every file is reviewed and actionable content extracted.

### 2. Stepwise Process
1. Divide file inventory into logical batches (by folder, type, or size).
2. For each batch:
   - Review every file line by line.
   - Extract/log actionable content.
   - Create new docs/templates/scripts as needed.
   - Mark each file as reviewed/processed in the task list.
   - Log all actions in the improvement log.
3. Repeat until all files are processed.

### 3. Notes
- No file is skipped, regardless of type/content.
- Continue without interruption until all batches are complete.

## Operational Logic
- Systematic, batch-driven, and traceable review/extraction process for the entire workspace.
- All actions and improvements are logged for traceability.
