# File Review Log: Autonomous AI Agent Development Plan - Iteration 05

## Actionable Extracts & Operational Logic

### 1. Core Vision & Guiding Principles
- **Absolute Context Fidelity:** Multi-stage, iterative process for plan decomposition, cross-referencing, constraint identification, iterative elaboration, and feedback loop integration.
- **Non-Negotiable Principles:** Verifiable/actionable outputs, modular/layered design, security-first, comprehensive error handling, explicit completion criteria, open-ended customization, rigorous requirements fulfillment, end-user focus, deep environmental awareness.
- **Enforcement:** Automated testing, static analysis, dependency injection, security audits, error taxonomies, completion criteria language, user studies, configuration files, adherence verification, and continuous validation.

### 2. Self-Governance & Plan Adherence
- **Plan Ingestion:** Automated pipeline to parse design docs into a Knowledge Graph (KG) using LLMs (DSPy, KGGen), with structural parsing of Markdown for high precision.
- **Adherence Verification:** MCP loop augmented with structured KG queries to check all actions against internalized principles; logs all checks for auditability.
- **Self-Correction:** Reflexion-inspired loop for plan discrepancies, with meta-prompts for critique and re-planning; capped retries and escalation to human if unresolved.
- **Proactive Optimization:** BDI model-driven background process for self-improvement, using operational logs and strategic mandates to drive internal refinements.

### 3. Human-AI Collaboration & Psychological Acuity
- **Affective Computing:** Multi-library emotion detection (VADER, text2emotion, spaCy), with confidence scores and clarifying questions for low-confidence cases.
- **Pragmatic NLU:** Gricean maxims, indirect speech act recognition, sarcasm detection, and context-driven intent inference.
- **Dynamic User Modeling:** Persistent, evolving user model (expertise, style, preferences, error patterns) as a KG subgraph, with decay and feedback mechanisms.
- **Misinformation Protocol:** Three-stage workflow (acknowledge/inquire, present evidence, collaborative resolution), with emotional state gating and multi-source verification.

### 4. Self-Evolving Tooling & Network Intelligence
- **CLI Tool Wrapping:** Hybrid TextFSM parsing + LLM semantic interpretation to auto-generate Python wrappers (Pydantic models, subprocess calls) from --help output.
- **API Client Generation:** Automated OpenAPI client generation (openapi-python-client, prance), dynamic import, and runtime integration.
- **Network Topology Mapping:** Continuous, real-time mapping using psutil, netifaces, python-nmap, scapy; all data ingested into KG for distributed scheduling and diagnostics.

### 5. Deepening & Hardening Capabilities
- **Edge Optimization:** Aggressive quantization, pruning, knowledge distillation, and efficient architectures (TinyLlama, Phi-3 Mini, llama.cpp) for mobile/edge deployment.
- **Model Management:** .aimodel packaging, ai-pack CLI, registry with REST API, dynamic model selection and LRU caching.
- **Distributed Compute:** User consent, TEE/WASM sandboxing, mutual TLS, gossip protocol, dynamic task partitioning, checkpointing, and chaos engineering for fault tolerance.
- **Static Analysis & Refactoring:** SonarQube, custom DRY/SOLID rules, iterative generate-validate-refactor loop, architectural checkpoints.
- **Error Handling:** Expanded error taxonomy, diagnostic pipelines, automated program repair (pattern, semantic, test-driven), and retry/escalation logic.
- **Security:** Circuit breakers, dry-run/rollback, containerization, SAST/DAST, dependency scanning, secrets management, pre-commit/push hooks.
- **User Documentation:** Dynamic adaptation to user model, explicit dependency checks, clarity/conciseness, example-driven, and proactive troubleshooting.
- **Environmental Awareness:** Real-time OS, terminal, Docker, and network context for dynamic adaptation and resource management.

### 6. Deliverables & KPIs
- **Roadmap:** Updated with new sub-phases for self-governance, psychological acuity, and autonomous tooling.
- **KPIs:** Quantitative metrics for self-governance, human collaboration, and tooling success (e.g., F1-score for KG extraction, emotion detection accuracy, CLI wrapping success rate).
- **Sourcing:** Annotated bibliography, in-code citations, and report citations for all claims and implementations.

## Operational Logic
- All new capabilities are grounded in existing, verifiable technologies and are to be implemented with exhaustive detail, robust error handling, and continuous self-improvement.
- Every process includes explicit failure modes and recovery mechanisms, with escalation to human oversight as a last resort.
- The agentâ€™s architecture is designed for maximum modularity, security, and adaptability, with a focus on edge deployment and decentralized compute.
- All user-facing outputs and internal operations are to be empirically validated, auditable, and dynamically adapted to user and environmental context.
