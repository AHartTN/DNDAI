## Actionable Extracts & Operational Logic

### 1. Campaign Generation Workflow
- User input via Discord/Twitch triggers campaign start or player action.
- Bot interface sends context/player actions to Narrative Engine (Llama 4).
- Narrative Engine generates story, DM notes, campaign hooks.
- Encounter Generator creates balanced encounters (party level, terrain).
- NPC & Creature Builder generates stat blocks, portraits for NPCs/monsters.
- Item & Artifact Generator produces loot, magic items, lore hooks.
- Visual Asset Pipeline (Stable Diffusion) generates images for NPCs, maps, artifacts.
- Bot interface returns narrative, images, and updates to players.

### 2. Encounter Resolution Workflow
- Player action triggers encounter (combat, social, exploration).
- Bot interface sends context to Encounter Generator.
- Encounter Generator returns details, balance, loot.
- NPC & Creature Builder provides stat blocks, portraits.
- Visual Asset Pipeline generates images.
- Bot interface manages turn order, actions, campaign state.

### 3. Image Asset Creation Workflow
- Narrative Engine or Item Generator produces image prompt.
- Visual Asset Pipeline receives prompt and style guide.
- Stable Diffusion generates image, returns URL/metadata.
- Bot interface displays image, updates campaign records.

### 4. Next Steps
- Implement API handlers for each workflow step.
- Create config files and environment variable management.
- Begin coding narrative engine and bot interface modules.
- Add automated tests for campaign and encounter workflows.

## Operational Logic
- Modular, stepwise workflow for campaign, encounter, and image asset generation.
- Clear separation of responsibilities between modules.
- API-driven, testable, and extensible process.
