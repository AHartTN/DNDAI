## Atomic, Granular Extraction and Operational Logic

- Describes a technical architecture for agent self-management and plan adherence, including:
  - Automated ingestion of development plans into a structured, queryable Knowledge Graph (KG).
  - Meta-cognitive planning loop with adherence verification against the KG.
  - Self-correction loop using linguistic feedback and the Reflexion framework.
  - Proactive operational improvement engine using the BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) model.
- All mechanisms are actionable and modular, suitable for implementation in agentic systems.

## Machine-Readable Definition of Done (DoD)
- [x] All actionable blueprints and operational logic extracted.
