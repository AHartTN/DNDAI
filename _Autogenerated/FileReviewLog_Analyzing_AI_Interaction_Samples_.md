# File Review Log: Analyzing AI Interaction Samples_.md

## Atomic, Granular Extraction and Operational Logic

### 1. Human-AI Interaction Patterns

- **AI-First Assistance:** AI provides initial solutions, user reviews or corrects.
- **Secondary Assistance:** AI offers supplementary info, user integrates as needed.
- **Request-Driven Assistance:** User initiates all AI help, fostering agency.
- **AI-Guided Dialogic Engagement:** AI elicits info via iterative dialogue, then acts.
- **User-Guided Adjustments:** User actively corrects/steers AI outputs, including interactive ML.
- **Delegation:** User/AI delegates tasks based on strengths, optimizing outcomes.
- **Temporal Trust Dynamics:** Interaction patterns and trust evolve over time, requiring longitudinal analysis.

### 2. Key Human-Centric and Ethical Dimensions

- **User Perception & Trust:** Trust in AI is utility-driven; human responses rated higher for authenticity/professionalism, especially when source is disclosed.
- **Transparency:** Disclosure of AI origin shifts trust; affinity bias favors human-like responses.
- **Empathy & Attachment:** AI lacks genuine empathy, limiting psychological attachment.
- **Communication Patterns:** Conversational agents are primary mode; utility-trust gap observed.
- **Privacy & Data Rights:** AI systems must minimize PII, ensure consent, and anonymize data.
- **Bias & Fairness:** Routine evaluation for bias is ethically required.
- **Emotional Harm & Manipulation:** Affective computing can manipulate; must avoid harm and bias.
- **Accountability:** AI must be auditable; responsibility gaps exist for autonomous actions.
- **Transparency & Explainability:** Contextual transparency is key—right info, right time, right format.

### 3. Analytical Methodology

- **Data Cataloging:** Systematic extraction of metadata (filename, date, agent, topic) and chronological organization.
- **Coding Scheme:** Mixed-methods—deductive (theory-driven) and inductive (data-driven) codes; use of QDA tools (ATLAS.ti, MAXQDA) with human validation.
- **Thematic Analysis:** Identify user adaptation, AI consistency/drift, task complexity, emotional dynamics, and interaction patterns.
- **Longitudinal Analysis:** Track co-evolution of user trust, adaptation, and ethical dilemmas over time.

### 4. Operational Logic Extracted

- All interaction patterns and ethical dimensions are to be encoded as modular, testable templates for agent design and evaluation.
- Data cataloging, coding, and analysis must be reproducible, with explicit anonymization and privacy protocols.
- Contextual transparency and user agency are required in all agent workflows.
- Routine bias, privacy, and accountability checks are mandatory for all AI deployments.
