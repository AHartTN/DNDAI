# File Review Log: D&D AI Ecosystem Research_.md

## Actionable Extracts & Findings
- **Vision:** Self-building, fully autonomous D&D AI ecosystem with true autonomy, emergent gameplay, and human-like interaction.
- **Architecture:** Distributed microservice model with a master orchestrator and specialized sub-agents (world builder, rules adjudicator, narrative engine, combat manager, social agent, player cores).
- **Meta-Programming:** System must generate, refactor, test, and deploy its own codebase, with robust CI/CD and rollback.
- **Memory & State:** Multi-layered memory (short-term, session, campaign, global knowledge base) with event-driven retrieval and seamless recovery.
- **Emergent Gameplay:** Requires dynamic narrative algorithms, knowledge graphs, and adaptive storytelling.
- **Hardware Optimization:** Distributed workload across heterogeneous hardware, with low-latency, high-throughput communication.
- **Self-Monitoring:** Introspection prompts, automated critique, hallucination detection, and confidence scoring are core to self-correction.

## Operational Logic
- Implement distributed, modular microservices with robust orchestration and state management.
- Prioritize meta-programming, self-correction, and continuous improvement.
- Integrate multi-layered memory and dynamic narrative systems.

## Status
Fully reviewed and actionable content extracted. See above for operational logic and implementation priorities.
