## Atomic, Granular Extraction and Operational Logic

### 1. Agent Autonomy Spectrum
- **Levels 1-5:** From simple processor (human-in-the-loop) to fully autonomous agent (self-directed, high risk/reward).
- **Key Patterns:** Autonomy, reactivity, proactivity, learning, multi-agent orchestration.
- **Frameworks:** AutoGen, CrewAI, LangChain, LangGraph, Agno; code samples for each autonomy level.

### 2. Memory Taxonomies & Hybrid Retrieval
- **Memory Types:** Episodic (experiential), Semantic (conceptual), Procedural (skills/behaviors).
- **Operations:** Consolidation, updating, indexing, forgetting, retrieval, compression.
- **Hybrid Retrieval:** RAG with knowledge graphs, Graph RAG, multi-model RAG, Graphiti (real-time, bi-temporal), vector DBs (Chroma, Pinecone, Qdrant, etc.).
- **Frameworks:** LangChain, LlamaIndex, Memgraph, Zep, LangMem, MemGPT, Pydantic AI.
- **Patterns:** Active management, hybrid search, memory utility/scalability, knowledge consistency.

### 3. Prompt Engineering (CoT, ToT, ReAct, Structured JSON)
- **CoT:** Stepwise reasoning, zero-shot/few-shot/auto-CoT, self-consistency.
- **ToT:** Tree-structured, parallel exploration, sampling/proposing/evaluation/search.
- **ReAct:** Interleaved reasoning and action, tool use, feedback-driven.
- **Structured JSON:** Deterministic, schema-driven, machine-readable outputs for integration.
- **Patterns:** Input semantics, output customization, error identification, prompt improvement, context control.
- **Frameworks:** LangChain, Opper AI.

### 4. Reflective QA Loops & Machine-Readable DoD
- **Reflective AI:** Meta-reasoning, self-assessment, episodic memory, iterative improvement.
- **QA Loops:** Generation-evaluation-feedback, self-correcting code, active learning, formal verification, executable specs, agentic self-validation, compliance monitoring.
- **Patterns:** Uncertainty quantification, active learning, formal verification, executable specs, agentic self-validation.
- **Tools:** LangGraph, AutoGen, modAL, smolagents, Local Operator, Aider, OpenHands, Dafny, VeriFast, GeneXus, Zapier, Blue Prism.

### 5. VS Code Extension Architecture & Security
- **Extension Isolation:** Separate process, limited API, lazy loading, activation events.
- **API Patterns:** Promises, cancellation tokens, disposables, events, Node.js modules.
- **Security Risks:** Broad permissions, no sandboxing, impersonation, typosquatting, supply chain, misleading verification, command hijacking, untrusted input, insecure comms.
- **Best Practices:** Marketplace protections, verified publishers, user due diligence, input validation, secure comms, security by design.
- **Security Tools:** OWASP Threat Dragon, IriusRisk, SonarLint, CodeQL, Bandit, Gosec, Brakeman, REST Client, Swagger Viewer.
- **Code Patterns:** Secure session management, input validation, webview security.

## Operational Logic Extracted
- All agent autonomy, memory, prompt engineering, and QA patterns are to be encoded as modular, testable components and templates.
- Hybrid retrieval, memory management, and prompt engineering must be implemented with active management, schema-driven outputs, and robust error handling.
- Reflective QA, machine-readable DoD, and agentic self-validation are required for all critical agent workflows.
- VS Code extension security must follow best practices, with explicit threat modeling, static analysis, and user education.
