## Atomic Extraction and Expansion of Content

### Overview
- **Purpose:** Provides a comprehensive, cross-referenced framework for geography and regions, with advanced expansion for campaign use.
- **Scope:** Region types, biomes, procedural generation, hazards, events, and campaign-specific hooks.

### Key Extracted and Expanded Content
- **Region Types & Biomes:**
  - Full spectrum of natural, magical, planar, and campaign-specific biomes and region types.
  - Expansion: Add "Hybrid Biomes" (e.g., volcanic-jungle, planar-urban) and "Dynamic Region States" (e.g., shifting boundaries, magical terraforming).
- **Random Region Generation Tables:**
  - Templates for procedural world-building: terrain, climate, population, resources, threats, magical phenomena, planar events, historical sites, artifact locations, faction territories.

- **Expansion Notes:**
  - All region profiles, travel tables, and hazard hooks are cross-checked for consistency with timeline, economy, and campaign docs.
  - Ambiguous mechanics or boundary disputes are flagged for future clarification.
  - All content is comprehensive, genre-accurate, and cross-referenced for campaign use.
