# Atomic Extracts from Architecting and Implementing a Self-Building, Fully Autonomous, and Human-Like Dungeons & Dragons AI Ecosystem_.md

## Blueprint: Self-Building AI Ecosystem Architecture

- Modular architecture for a self-building, autonomous DnD AI system.
- Includes: agent roles, communication protocols, and self-improvement cycles.

## Blueprint: Agent Role Specialization

- Atomic definitions for specialized agent roles (e.g., Worldbuilder, Narrator, Rule Arbiter).

## Operational Logic: Autonomous Module Integration

- Logic for integrating new modules autonomously, including validation and rollback.

## Blueprint: Human-Like Interaction Simulation

- Stepwise process for simulating human-like interactions in DnD scenarios.

## Prompt Template: Agent Collaboration

- Example prompt for facilitating collaboration between specialized agents.

## Code Snippet: Module Registration Handler (Pseudocode)

- Pseudocode for registering and validating new modules in the ecosystem.
