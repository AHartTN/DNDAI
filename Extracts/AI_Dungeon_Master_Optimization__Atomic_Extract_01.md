# Atomic Extract: T-SQL Schema and Context Retrieval for AI Dungeon Master

## Source: Research/AI Dungeon Master Optimization_.md

### Key Actionable Content
- **Data Architecture**: Categorize campaign data, history, lore, AI/user-generated content; implement deduplication/versioning for unique content.
- **T-SQL Schema**: Define normalized tables for Campaigns, Sessions, Characters, Locations, Items, LoreEntries, Events, CharacterStates, Relationships, VectorEmbeddings.
- **Context Retrieval**: Use stored procedures, views, and targeted queries for efficient context extraction; apply RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) patterns for AI context.
- **AI Model Integration**: Assess hardware requirements for Llama 4/Stable Diffusion; recommend hybrid local/cloud deployment for large models.
- **Performance Optimization**: Apply mixed-precision quantization, model/data parallelism, and context window management for scalable inference.
- **API Integration**: Use C# ASP.NET Core APIs with repository/unit-of-work patterns; recommend microservices for Python/TypeScript compatibility.
- **Semantic Search**: Store vector embeddings in T-SQL/VARBINARY(MAX); recommend hybrid vector DB for scalable semantic search.
- **Implementation Blueprint**: Follow phased development (DB/API, AI integration, semantic search, optimization, scaling) and rigorous testing/monitoring.
