# Atomic Extract: Exhaustive Review and Extraction Blueprint

## Source: _Autogenerated/Blueprint_Exhaustive_Review_and_Extraction.md

### Key Actionable Content

- **Recursive Review**: List every file/folder, perform line-by-line review, extract actionable content, log review status/findings for all files (including empty/binary), and enforce security/compliance at every step.
- **Logging and Traceability**: Dedicated FileReviewLog for every file, with machine-readable DoD and QA/compliance checkpoints.
- **Synthesis and Compaction**: Summarize actionable patterns, update workspace map, topics index, and master checklist; create new blueprints/templates as required.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Log new documents/improvements, periodically summarize/compact content, and update blueprints/prompts for modularity and reuse.

**Cross-Reference**: See AI-Behavior.md and system blueprints for compliance and improvement standards.
