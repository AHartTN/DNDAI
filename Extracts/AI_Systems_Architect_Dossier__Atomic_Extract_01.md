# Atomic Extract: World-Leading AI Systems Architecture

## Source: Research/AI Systems Architect Dossier_.md

### Key Actionable Content
- **Agent Autonomy**: Five-level spectrum from simple processor to fully autonomous agent; balance efficiency with safety/ethical risks.
- **Memory Management**: Taxonomies (episodic, semantic, procedural); hybrid retrieval (RAG, knowledge graphs, vector DBs); memory operations (consolidation, updating, retrieval).
- **Prompt Engineering**: Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thought, ReAct, structured JSON; patterns for reasoning, output control, error identification, and context management.
- **Reflective QA**: Self-correction, machine-readable Definition of Done, uncertainty quantification, active learning, formal verification, agentic self-validation.
- **Extension Security**: VS Code extension architecture, isolation, activation events, security risks (permissions, supply chain, input validation), and best practices (threat modeling, SAST, secure comms).
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Centralized/decentralized patterns, orchestration frameworks (AutoGen, CrewAI, LangChain, LangGraph), agent communication protocols (ACP, FIPA ACL).
- **Persistence**: Polyglot strategy (SQL, NoSQL, Redis, vector DBs), RAG persistence, data lineage, reproducibility, and cost/scalability considerations.
