# Atomic Extract: Systematic Batch Processing Blueprint

## Source: _Autogenerated/Blueprint_Systematic_Batch_Processing.md

### Key Actionable Content

- **Batch Processing**: Divide file inventory into logical batches, review each file line by line, extract actionable content, log findings/actions/compliance, create new docs/templates/scripts as needed, mark files as reviewed, enforce security/compliance, cross-reference outputs, repeat until all files processed.
- **No Skipping**: Every file is processed, regardless of type/content.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Enforce compliance/operational mandates, iterate for completeness/accuracy, and synthesize all actionable content.
