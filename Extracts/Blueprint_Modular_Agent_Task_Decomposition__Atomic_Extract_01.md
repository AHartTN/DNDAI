# Atomic Extract: Modular Agent Task Decomposition Blueprint

## Source: _Autogenerated/Blueprint_Modular_Agent_Task_Decomposition.md

### Key Actionable Content

- **Task Decomposition**: Parse user/operational requests, decompose into atomic modular subtasks, execute/log each subtask, synthesize unified output, cross-reference with research/security/compliance, iterate for completeness.
- **Traceability**: Log outputs, decisions, and lessons in a dedicated improvement log.
- **Blueprint Alignment**: Ensure all subtasks and outputs align with current blueprints and operational logic.
