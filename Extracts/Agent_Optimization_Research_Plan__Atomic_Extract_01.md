# Atomic Extract: Agentic Reasoning Frameworks and Token-Efficient Task Execution

## Source: Research/Agent Optimization Research Plan_.md

### Key Actionable Content
- **Agentic Reasoning Frameworks**: ReAct, Tree of Thoughts (ToT), Prompt Chaining, Symbolic Linking, and Prompt Compression are advanced frameworks for structuring LLM agent reasoning and improving reliability in complex, multi-step tasks.
- **Token Efficiency**: Use symbolic file references and prompt chaining to minimize context window bloat and maximize agent performance in long-running tasks.
- **Blueprint Example**: ReAct API Implementation and ToT Cross-File Refactoring prompt templates for VS Code Copilot agent mode.
- **Self-Correction**: Metacognitive Prompting and Reflexion frameworks enable agents to self-reflect, learn from mistakes, and improve over multiple attempts.
- **Guardrails**: Constitutional AI and instruction hierarchy techniques for non-overridable system prompts to defend against prompt injection and ensure agent alignment.
- **Operational Deliverables**: Production-grade copilot-instructions.md, custom MCP server starter script, and a fully automated project scaffolding script for agent orchestration.
