# Atomic Extract: Hierarchical Research Planning and Dynamic Adaptation

## Source: Research/Agent_s Role and Plan Generation_.md

### Key Actionable Content
- **Hierarchical Planning**: Decompose high-level research objectives into a tree of granular, executable tasks for AI agent delegation.
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Implement goal re-evaluation triggers and meta-reflection to enable agents to adapt plans based on observed outcomes and new discoveries.
- **Data Governance**: Use contextual security models (OAuth 2.0, OIDC, Microsoft Purview) for secure, auditable data access and compliance.
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**: Integrate mandatory human validation checkpoints for data quality, model validation, and final report review.
- **Self-Improvement**: Employ ReAct and Reflexion paradigms for system-wide feedback, learning from failures, and meta-learning for planning optimization.
- **Output Specification**: Define clear deliverables (final report, data visualizations, version-controlled repository) and evaluation metrics (accuracy, efficiency, cost).
