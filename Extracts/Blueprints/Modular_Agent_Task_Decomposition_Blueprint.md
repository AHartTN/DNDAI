# DNDAI Modular Agent Task Decomposition Blueprint

## Purpose
Blueprint for parsing user/operational requests, decomposing into atomic modular subtasks, and auto-generating code stubs and logs for each subtask.

## Steps
1. Parse user/operational request.
2. Decompose into atomic, modular subtasks.
3. For each subtask:
   - Generate code stub (Python, YAML, etc.)
   - Log output, decision, and lessons in improvement log.
4. Synthesize unified output and cross-reference with blueprints.
5. Iterate for completeness and traceability.

## Example (Python Pseudocode)
def decompose_task(request):
    """Decompose a high-level request into atomic subtasks and generate stubs/logs."""
    subtasks = parse_request(request)
    for sub in subtasks:
        generate_stub(sub)
        log_improvement(sub)
    synthesize_output(subtasks)
