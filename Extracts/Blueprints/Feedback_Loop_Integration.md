# Feedback Loop Integration Blueprint

Process for integrating user and system feedback into iterative model improvement:

1. Collect feedback from users and automated monitoring systems.
2. Classify feedback by type (e.g., bug, suggestion, compliment, critical error).
3. Prioritize feedback based on severity and frequency.
4. Implement changes or escalate to development as needed.
5. Track outcomes and re-evaluate after each iteration.
