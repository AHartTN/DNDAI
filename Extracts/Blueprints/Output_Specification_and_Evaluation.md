# Output Specification and Evaluation Metrics

- Define clear deliverables for each project phase (e.g., final report, data visualizations, code repository).
- Specify evaluation metrics: accuracy, efficiency, cost, user satisfaction, compliance.
- Use version control for all deliverables.
- Review outputs against requirements and metrics at each milestone.
