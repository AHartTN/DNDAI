# AI Model Integration and Performance Optimization

## Model Integration
- Assess hardware requirements for Llama 4/Stable Diffusion.
- Recommend hybrid local/cloud deployment for large models.
- Use C# ASP.NET Core APIs with repository/unit-of-work patterns.
- Recommend microservices for Python/TypeScript compatibility.

## Performance Optimization
- Apply mixed-precision quantization, model/data parallelism, and context window management for scalable inference.
- Follow phased development: DB/API, AI integration, semantic search, optimization, scaling, and rigorous testing/monitoring.
