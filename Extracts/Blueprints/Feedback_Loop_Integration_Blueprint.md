# DNDAI Feedback Loop Integration Blueprint

## Purpose
Blueprint for integrating user and system feedback into iterative model improvement.

## Steps
1. Collect user/system feedback after each major action or output.
2. Categorize feedback (positive, negative, suggestion, error report).
3. Analyze feedback for recurring patterns or actionable items.
4. Update prompts, scripts, or blueprints as needed.
5. Log all changes and improvements in the running improvement log.
6. Periodically review feedback log for further optimization opportunities.

## Example (Python Pseudocode)
def integrate_feedback(feedback_log):
    for entry in feedback_log:
        if entry['type'] == 'suggestion':
            update_blueprint(entry['content'])
        elif entry['type'] == 'error report':
            update_script(entry['content'])
    summarize_feedback(feedback_log)
