# Error Pattern Detection Logic

Logic for identifying recurring error patterns in AI responses:

1. Categorize errors by type (e.g., misunderstanding, hallucination, omission, repetition).
2. Track frequency and context of each error type.
3. Map root causes (e.g., ambiguous prompt, insufficient context, model limitation).
4. Aggregate and visualize error trends over time.
5. Recommend targeted interventions for high-frequency or high-impact errors.
