# Extension Security and Multi-Agent Orchestration

## Extension Security
- Use VS Code extension architecture with isolation and activation events.
- Mitigate risks: permissions, supply chain, input validation.
- Apply best practices: threat modeling, SAST, secure communications.

## Multi-Agent Orchestration
- Centralized and decentralized orchestration patterns.
- Use frameworks: AutoGen, CrewAI, LangChain, LangGraph.
- Agent communication protocols: ACP, FIPA ACL.
