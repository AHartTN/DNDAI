# Agent Autonomy Spectrum and Memory Taxonomies

## Agent Autonomy Levels

1. Level 1: Simple processor (follows direct instructions)
2. Level 2: Task executor (executes modular tasks)
3. Level 3: Adaptive agent (modifies plan based on feedback)
4. Level 4: Self-improving agent (learns from outcomes, optimizes process)
5. Level 5: Fully autonomous agent (sets goals, self-governs, self-corrects)

## Memory Taxonomies

- Episodic: Stores specific events and experiences
- Semantic: Stores facts, concepts, and knowledge
- Procedural: Stores skills, processes, and routines
- Hybrid: Combines multiple memory types (e.g., RAG, knowledge graphs, vector DBs)

## Memory Operations

- Consolidation, updating, retrieval, pruning, and context management
