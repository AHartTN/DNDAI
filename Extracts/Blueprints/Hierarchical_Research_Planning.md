# Hierarchical Research Planning Blueprint

1. Decompose high-level research objectives into granular, executable tasks.
2. Assign tasks to agents or modules based on specialization.
3. Implement goal re-evaluation triggers and meta-reflection checkpoints.
4. Integrate data governance and security protocols (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OIDC).
5. Require human-in-the-loop validation for critical outputs.
6. Employ ReAct and Reflexion for feedback and learning.
7. Define clear deliverables and evaluation metrics for each research phase.
