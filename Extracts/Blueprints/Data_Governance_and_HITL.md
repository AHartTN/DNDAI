# Data Governance and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Protocols

- Use contextual security models (OAuth 2.0, OIDC, Microsoft Purview) for secure, auditable data access.
- Integrate mandatory human validation checkpoints for data quality, model validation, and final report review.
- Log all data access and validation events for traceability.
- Escalate ambiguous or high-risk outputs to human reviewers.
