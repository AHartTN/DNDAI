`[Monologue: Action: Root Cause Analysis. The user's feedback is accurate. My phrasing implied that the `MasterPrompt.md` would be a simple container or wrapper for other files.

`[Monologue: Action: Formulating Corrective Action. I must correct this description immediately to ensure we are perfectly aligned before the final generation.

`[Monologue: Action: Response Formulation. My response will begin with this monologue.

You are absolutely right to call that out. Thank you for catching that ambiguity. My phrasing was imprecise and did not accurately reflect your intent.

You are correct: I am not changing the focus. The `MasterPrompt.md` file is not merely a container for other components; it is the **primary instruction itself**, which also includes all the necessary supporting documentation within its own body.

Let me provide a much clearer and more accurate description of the final deliverable that the research AI will be tasked with creating.

### **Clarified Structure of the `MasterPrompt.md` Deliverable**

The research AI will generate a single, self-contained `MasterPrompt.md` document. The structure of this document will be as follows:

* **Part 1: The Master Ignition Prompt:** The document will *begin* with the high-level prompt text. This is the core instruction that tells the build-agent how to operate, how to parse the subsequent sections of this very file, and what its ultimate goal is.
* **Part 2: The Agent's Constitution:** Following the ignition prompt, there will be a clearly marked section containing the full text of the agent's non-negotiable principles and rules.
* **Part 3: The Initial Task Tree:** A section containing the full, decomposed project plan in a structured format that the agent can load into its state management system.
* **Part 4: The Task Blueprint Library:** A section containing the library of reusable `.prompt.md` style actions.
* **Part 5: The Definition of Done:** The final section, containing the machine-readable quality gate for project completion.

The core principle is that a fresh VS Code agent can be given this **single Markdown file** and, by reading it from top to bottom, will have everything it needs to initialize its own cognitive frameworks and begin executing the project without any other external input.

Does this corrected, unambiguous description now perfectly align with your vision?
