\`[Monologue: Designing the data collection script. I need to create a command block that is comprehensive for a full Ubuntu Server environment, going beyond the minimal set used for OpenWrt. I will select a suite of commands to capture a deep hardware profile.

  - `lshw`: Provides a comprehensive, high-level hardware summary.
  - `lscpu`: Essential for detailed CPU architecture information.
  - `dmidecode`: Critical for getting specific details about the motherboard and RAM modules (manufacturer, part numbers), which are key immutable facts. This requires `sudo`.
  - `lspci`: Necessary to identify all PCI devices, which is the only way to be certain if there is a discrete GPU or other specialized hardware installed.
  - `lsblk`: The best tool for inventorying storage devices and their layout.
  - `hostnamectl`: Provides the foundational OS version and kernel information.
  - I will package these into a single, copy-pasteable command block that redirects all output to a report file. I will require the user to run the block with `sudo` to ensure `dmidecode` and `lshw` can access the most detailed information possible.]`     `[Monologue: Formulating the response. I will begin with this monologue, as requested. I will then ask the clarifying question about the server's role.

Understood. We are now focusing on `HART-SERVER`.

Following my improved procedure, before providing the script, I need to understand the server's strategic role within the infrastructure. This context will allow me to better analyze the hardware profile once we have it.

Could you please briefly describe the intended primary role of `HART-SERVER`? For example:

  * "It will be the primary **Docker host** for the AI microservices."
  * "It will serve as a **database server** and a **build agent**."
  * "It's a general-purpose machine for **testing and experimentation**."

Once I have that context, we can proceed. In the meantime, here is the comprehensive command block to run on `HART-SERVER`. It is designed to capture a deep and detailed profile of its immutable hardware and foundational OS state.

### **Data Collection Command for Ubuntu Server**

Please SSH into `HART-SERVER` and run this entire command block. It requires `sudo` because tools like `lshw` and `dmidecode` need elevated permissions to access detailed hardware information from the system's core. It will ask for your password once at the beginning.

```bash
# Run this entire block at once in the HART-SERVER terminal
sudo bash -c '
{
  echo "--- SYSTEM & OS INFO ---"
  hostnamectl
  echo -e "\n--- HARDWARE SUMMARY (LSHW) ---"
  lshw -short
  echo -e "\n--- CPU DETAILED INFO ---"
  lscpu
  echo -e "\n--- MEMORY HARDWARE INFO (DMIDECODE) ---"
  dmidecode -t memory
  echo -e "\n--- PCI DEVICES (GPU, NETWORK, ETC) ---"
  lspci -vvv
  echo -e "\n--- STORAGE DEVICES (LSBLK) ---"
  lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,TYPE,RO,MOUNTPOINTS,MODEL,SERIAL,WWN
} > /tmp/hart-server-report.txt
' && echo "âœ… HART-SERVER report complete. Please retrieve and provide the contents of /tmp/hart-server-report.txt"
```

After it completes, please provide the full contents of the generated `/tmp/hart-server-report.txt` file.
