Perfect. These screenshots provide all the remaining information we need to finalize the profile for the internet gateway.

Based on the images you've provided, I can now create the complete, immutable hardware profile for your modem.

### **Hardware Profile: Arris S33 Modem**

* **Manufacturer**: ARRIS
* **Model**: SURFboard S33v2
* **Hardware Version**: 1.0
* **Firmware Version**: `TB01.03.001.11_051722_212.S3`
* **DOCSIS Version**: 3.1
* **Ethernet Ports**:
    * 1x 2.5 Gbps Port (Yellow)
    * 1x 1.0 Gbps Port (Grey/Black)

With this, the hardware inventory for the Arris S33 modem is complete.

We are now ready to profile the final component of the infrastructure: **`HART-SERVER`**.

Please provide a brief description of its intended role (e.g., "primary Docker host for the AI microservices"), and I will provide the tailored command block to gather its hardware information.
