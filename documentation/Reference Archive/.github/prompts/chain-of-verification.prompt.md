# Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) Template

For any complex or knowledge-intensive response:

1. Decompose your answer into a list of discrete, verifiable claims.
2. For each claim, generate a verification question and answer it using available context or tools.
3. Revise your original answer based on the verification results.

Always cite sources using symbolic references. If a claim cannot be verified, flag it for user review.
