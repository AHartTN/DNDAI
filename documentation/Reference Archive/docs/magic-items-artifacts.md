# Magic Items & Artifacts

## Purpose

This document provides guidelines and templates for designing, generating, and integrating magic items and artifacts in the AI Dungeon Master system. It covers item rarity, effects, lore, and campaign integration.

## Item Design Workflow

1. **Define Item Concept:** Name, type, rarity, and campaign role.
2. **Assign Effects:** Mechanical bonuses, magical abilities, curses, and drawbacks.
3. **Write Lore:** Origin story, previous owners, and campaign hooks.
4. **Balance:** Compare with existing items for power level and genre fit.
5. **Image Prompt:** Create a prompt for visual asset generation (see [AI Module API Contracts](ai-module-api-contracts.md)).
6. **Integration:** Add to item database and update [Core System Mechanics](core-system-mechanics.md) as needed.

## Example: Legendary Artifact

- **Name:** Crown of the Planar Regent
- **Type:** Wondrous item (artifact)
- **Rarity:** Artifact
- **Effect:** Grants the wearer resistance to all damage, the ability to cast Plane Shift once per day, and advantage on Charisma checks against extraplanar beings.
- **Lore:** Forged by the first planar king, lost during the Sundering of Ashvale, sought by planar factions.
