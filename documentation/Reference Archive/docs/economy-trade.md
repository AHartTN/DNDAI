# Economy & Trade

## Purpose

This document details the economic systems, trade networks, and resource management mechanics for the AI Dungeon Master system. It provides frameworks for simulating markets, currencies, trade routes, and economic events in campaign settings.

## Economic Systems

- **Currencies:** Gold, silver, copper, platinum, electrum, and campaign-specific coins or barter systems.
- **Trade Networks:** Major trade routes, merchant guilds, caravans, and smuggling operations.
- **Resource Management:** Rules for inventory, supply, demand, and scarcity.
- **Market Events:** Price fluctuations, shortages, surpluses, and economic crises.
- **Economic Hooks:** Quests, rumors, and conflicts driven by trade and wealth.

## Step-by-Step: Creating a Market Event

1. **Define Event Type:** Shortage, surplus, embargo, discovery, or crisis.
2. **Determine Affected Goods:** Which items or resources are impacted?
3. **Set Economic Impact:** Price changes, NPC reactions, and campaign consequences.
4. **Integrate with Story:** Tie event to ongoing plots, factions, or world events.
5. **Test & Validate:** Simulate outcomes and adjust for balance (see [Testing & Validation](testing-and-validation.md)).
