# Magic System

## Purpose

This document outlines the rules, logic, and extensibility of the magic system used by the AI Dungeon Master. It covers spellcasting, magical effects, item interactions, and integration with world lore and campaign mechanics.

## Magic System Overview

- **Spellcasting:** Rules for preparing, casting, and resolving spells for both players and AI-controlled entities.
- **Spell Lists:** Modular spell lists by class, tradition, and campaign setting.
- **Magic Schools:** Descriptions and mechanics for abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, transmutation, and homebrew schools.
- **Resource Management:** Spell slots, components, and magical fatigue.
- **Magical Effects:** Persistent effects, area-of-effect, concentration, and dispelling.
- **Integration:** Magic interacts with [Core System Mechanics](core-system-mechanics.md), [Creatures & Encounters](creatures-encounters.md), and [Magic Items & Artifacts](magic-items-artifacts.md).

## Step-by-Step: Adding a New Spell or Effect

1. **Define Spell/Effect:** Name, school, level, and description.
2. **Specify Mechanics:** Range, duration, components, saving throws, and effects.
3. **Balance:** Compare with existing spells for power level and campaign fit.
4. **Integration:** Update spell lists and ensure compatibility with AI logic.
5. **Documentation:** Add to this file and cross-reference related modules.

## Example: Homebrew Spell

- **Name:** Shadowstep
- **School:** Conjuration
- **Level:** 3
- **Effect:** Teleport up to 60 feet to a shadowed area as a bonus action. If used to escape combat, triggers an opportunity attack at disadvantage.
