# AI Implementation Sample Workflow

## Campaign Generation
1. Bot receives user input (e.g., campaign start, player action) via Discord/Twitch.
2. Bot interface sends context and player actions to Narrative Engine (Llama 4).
3. Narrative Engine generates story, DM notes, and next campaign hooks.
4. Encounter Generator creates balanced encounters based on party level and terrain.
5. NPC & Creature Builder generates stat blocks and portraits for new NPCs/monsters.
6. Item & Artifact Generator produces loot, magic items, and lore hooks.
7. Visual Asset Pipeline (Stable Diffusion) generates images for NPCs, maps, and artifacts.
8. Bot interface returns narrative, images, and campaign updates to players.

## Encounter Resolution
1. Player action triggers encounter (combat, social, exploration).
2. Bot interface sends encounter context to Encounter Generator.
3. Encounter Generator returns encounter details, balance rating, and loot.
4. NPC & Creature Builder provides stat blocks and portraits for involved NPCs/monsters.
5. Visual Asset Pipeline generates relevant images.
6. Bot interface manages turn order, actions, and updates campaign state.

## Image Asset Creation
1. Narrative Engine or Item Generator produces image prompt.
2. Visual Asset Pipeline receives prompt and style guide.
3. Stable Diffusion generates image and returns URL/metadata.
4. Bot interface displays image to players and updates campaign records.

## Next Steps
- Implement API handlers for each workflow step.
- Create configuration files and environment variable management.
- Begin coding narrative engine and bot interface modules.
- Add automated tests for campaign generation and encounter resolution.
