# Dungeons & Sites

## Purpose

This document provides guidelines and templates for designing, generating, and integrating dungeons, adventure sites, and key locations in the AI Dungeon Master system. It covers mapping, encounter placement, environmental hazards, and narrative integration.

## Dungeon Design Workflow

1. **Define Site Type:** Dungeon, ruin, fortress, planar gate, magical anomaly, etc.
2. **Map Layout:** Create a map or flowchart of rooms, corridors, and key features.
3. **Populate Encounters:** Place creatures, traps, puzzles, and NPCs using [Creatures & Encounters](creatures-encounters.md).
4. **Environmental Hazards:** Add traps, magical effects, and environmental challenges.
5. **Narrative Integration:** Tie site to campaign hooks, world lore, and ongoing storylines.
6. **Test & Validate:** Simulate exploration and adjust for balance (see [Testing & Validation](testing-and-validation.md)).

## Example: Planar Ruin

- **Type:** Planar Ruin
- **Map:** 5 chambers connected by magical portals, each with unique hazards
- **Encounters:** Planar guardians, magical traps, artifact puzzle
- **Narrative Hook:** Site is the key to stopping a planar incursion
