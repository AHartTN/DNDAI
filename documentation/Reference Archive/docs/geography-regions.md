# Geography & Regions

## Purpose

This document provides frameworks and templates for designing, generating, and integrating regions, nations, and geographical features in the AI Dungeon Master system. It covers mapping, climate, resources, and regional conflicts.

## Region Design Workflow

1. **Define Region Type:** Kingdom, city-state, wilderness, planar realm, etc.
2. **Map Geography:** Draw or describe terrain, climate, and key features.
3. **Assign Resources:** Natural resources, trade goods, and magical sites.
4. **Populate Inhabitants:** Major NPCs, factions, and creatures.
5. **Regional Conflicts:** Wars, rivalries, and environmental hazards.
6. **Integrate with Campaign:** Tie region to world history, culture, and ongoing storylines.

## Example: Planar Region

- **Map:** Dense, shifting woods with portals to other realms
- **Resources:** Feywild fruits, magical springs, rare herbs
- **Inhabitants:** Fey courts, planar beasts, lost travelers
- **Conflicts:** Border skirmishes with shadow realm, magical storms
