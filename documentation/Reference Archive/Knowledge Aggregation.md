## 1. Project Intent & AI System Design

- **Goal:** Build a modular, scalable, AI-powered Dungeon Master suite for D&D, using Llama 4, Stable Diffusion, and other models.
- **Design:** Python for AI/model logic, Node.js/TypeScript for Discord/Twitch integrations.
- **Key Principles:** Modularity, extensibility, persistent campaign memory, multimodal input/output, robust API contracts.

## 2. Documentation Types & Roles

### a. AI System Architecture & Implementation

- `documentation/ai-implementation-architecture.md`: Modular system design, module breakdown, extensibility.
- `documentation/ai-module-api-contracts.md`: API/data contracts for all modules (narrative, encounter, NPC, item, image).
- `documentation/ai-system-configuration.md`: Environment/configuration details for models, tokens, and data.
- `README.md`: Project overview, setup, modular design, and recent changes.
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: Coding standards and workspace rules.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Chronological log of all major changes and features.
- `context-document.md`: Comprehensive reference for world generation, system mechanics, templates, and procedural tools.

### b. Research & Model Guidance

- `documentation/model-download-instructions.md`: How to obtain and set up Llama/Stable Diffusion models.
- `Strategic Plan for a Robust and Highly Performant AI Dungeon Master.docx`: Strategic planning for AI DM.
- `AI Dungeon Master Optimization_.docx`: Optimization strategies for AI DM.

### c. D&D Content Samples & References

- `documentation/creatures-encounters.md`: Monster roles, encounter balance, templates, terrain tables, boss frameworks.
- `documentation/npc-character-templates.md`: NPC archetypes, motivations, gear, quirks, and relationships.
- `documentation/magic-items-artifacts.md`: Item rarities, attunement, bonuses, curses, sentience, lore, crafting, upgrades.
- `documentation/random-tables-generators.md`: Name, quest, plot, weather, rumor, and loot generators.
- `documentation/dm-reference-style-guide.md`: Narration, improv, session management, DM tools, and templates.
- `test_dungeon_master_ai.py`: Example/test code for AI DM features.

### d. Worldbuilding & Lore

- `documentation/core-system-mechanics.md`: Stats, skills, spells, classes, backgrounds, advancement, and variant rules.
- `documentation/appendices.md`: Cosmology, world map, major NPCs, factions, races, and cultures.
- `documentation/culture-society.md`: Social classes, hierarchies, etiquette, intrigue, and diplomacy.
- `documentation/dungeons-sites.md`: Dungeon blueprints, traps, treasure, generation tables, hazards, and pacing.
- `documentation/economy-trade.md`: Currency, tax structures, guilds, merchant companies, and economic systems.
- `documentation/feudal-obligations-succession.md`: Feudal ranks, succession laws, obligations, and crisis events.
- `documentation/geography-regions.md`: Biomes, procedural generation, hazards, and events.
- `documentation/glossary.md`: Definitions of feudal, administrative, and campaign terms.
- `documentation/magic-system.md`: Spellcasting, research, rituals, traditions, hazards, and artifact creation.

- `documentation/images/genealogy-ashvale-diagram-prompt.txt`: Prompt for genealogy diagram for House Ashvale.

### e. Implementation & API

- `api_server.py`: Flask API server exposing endpoints for all core modules.

### f. Meta & Utility

- `Table of Contents.md`: Navigational map of all documentation and code.
- `Knowledge Aggregation.md`: This living summary and aggregation.
- `system_audit_hart-server_2025-07-22.log`: Hardware and storage details for deployment server.

### Deprecated/Obsolete

- `documentation/Llama Documentation.txt`: (Outdated/expired) Llama model access and usage instructions. No longer needed.

## 3. Aggregation Strategy

- **AI System Docs:** Focus on architecture, module APIs, and integration points. These are the foundation for building the AI.
- **Research/Planning:** Guides and plans for model selection, optimization, and deployment. Use these to inform design decisions.
- **Samples/References:** Not for direct use in the final product, but essential for training, testing, and understanding the scope of DM tasks.
- **Worldbuilding/Lore:** Provides the context and content types the AI must be able to generate, manage, and reference.
- **Implementation & Meta:** Ensure all scripts, API endpoints, and meta-docs are cataloged for onboarding and automation.

## 4. Next Steps

- Continue cataloging and summarizing each document's purpose and content.
- Begin extracting actionable requirements and design patterns from architecture and research docs.
- Clearly separate AI system design, research, and sample/reference content in all future documentation.

[Copilot Status Output]
This aggregation is a living summary. Update as new files are added or as the project focus evolves. Distinctions between AI-building docs, research, and samples are maintained for clarity and future automation.
