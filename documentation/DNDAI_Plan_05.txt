As an AI, I don't have a traditional working directory or the ability to store files between our conversations. My "memory" is the context of our current session. I also cannot access any of your personal services like Google Drive; all of my analysis is based solely on the information you provide here.

Now, here is the revised report for `HART-ROUTER`, updated with the strict "hardware-only" focus.

### **(Revised) HART-ROUTER Profile for Research Prompt**

**Overall Objective:** This document inventories the hardware assets of `HART-ROUTER`. It is one component of a larger infrastructure designed to develop and host a "microservice" AI Dungeon Master. The end goal is a comprehensive plan for a VS Code agent to configure this entire infrastructure from a clean state to achieve this objective.

#### **Research Directives**

1.  **System Configuration:**
    * Generate a complete, production-ready OpenWrt configuration (`/etc/config/network`, `/etc/config/wireless`, `/etc/config/firewall`, etc.) to establish this hardware as an intelligent network core.
2.  **Feature Implementation:**
    * The configuration must implement the following strategic goals:
        * Network-wide ad blocking.
        * Automated SSL certificate management via Let's Encrypt for internal services.
        * Network isolation/segmentation (VLANs) for security and traffic management.
        * Maximum performance tuning for the given hardware.
3.  **Azure Integration:**
    * Design a strategy for the router to streamline Azure integrations for the local network. This should include methods to simplify authentication or provide secure, persistent access for other devices (like `HART-SERVER`) to Azure resources, potentially via a site-to-site VPN.
4.  **Performance Assessment:**
    * Evaluate the inventoried hardware's ability to run all the specified services simultaneously and identify any potential performance bottlenecks.
