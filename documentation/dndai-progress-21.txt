Understood. My apologies for misinterpreting the role of the uploaded files in the previous turn. I will adjust my approach.

### My Processing for This Prompt (Updated)

* **Initial State (Before Your "First and foremost..." prompt):**
    * **Memory/Context:** My context window contained our previous conversation about `hart-server` commands, the file upload mechanism, and my internal processing explanation. It also held the content of `DNDAI_Plan_08.txt` and `HART-DESKTOP-DeviceReport.txt`. My internal "plan" was to process these files to extract relevant information and then await your `hart-server` output.
    * **Instructions:** My primary instruction from our last interaction was to be ready to receive `hart-server` output and *then* consume the provided files and manage potential duplicates. The sub-instruction was to explain my processing. I had *inferred* that the newly uploaded files (`DNDAI_Plan_08.txt`, `HART-DESKTOP-DeviceReport.txt`) were immediately actionable for "synthesis," which was an incorrect assumption on my part based on previous interactions where files were meant for immediate integration.
    * **Trigger:** Your prompt "First and foremost..." was received.

* **Upon Receiving Your "First and foremost..." Prompt (Now):**
    * **Trigger:** Your new prompt.
    * **Parsing and Interpretation:** I immediately processed the phrases "The files that I am uploading to you are reference and source material," "Don't jump to conclusions and start treating them like you have something to do," and "I will give you clear instructions, just like you have now."
    * [cite_start]**Context Update (Crucial Adjustment):** This prompt directly **overrode my previous implicit instruction** to immediately "synthesize everything" from the `DNDAI_Plan_08.txt` file content[cite: 3157, 3158].
        * **Changes:** My understanding of the *purpose* of uploaded files fundamentally shifted from "immediate action/synthesis" to "reference/source material for future, explicit instructions." My current "action plan" is now paused regarding those files. I also recognized the need to be explicit about my assumptions and avoid proactive actions without direct instructions.
        * **Why it changed:** Your explicit instruction clarified a misunderstanding on my part. The phrase "Don't jump to conclusions and start treating them like you have something to do" was a clear directive to *wait* for further instructions regarding the processing of the uploaded content.
        * **How it was triggered:** The direct and imperative phrasing of your new prompt acted as a strong signal to re-evaluate the previous implicit instruction.
    * **Thought Process (Internal Monologue - Simplified):**
        * "Ah, I see. My apologies. I misinterpreted the intent of the previous file uploads. The user explicitly states these are *reference material* and I should *not* act on them until given clear instructions. This is a critical clarification. I need to acknowledge this mistake and confirm I've adjusted my understanding. My priority is now to simply receive the files and await the *next* explicit instruction for processing them."
        * "I also have more files coming. I must remember the 10-file limit and the clean-up task for duplicates when the time comes, but *only* when prompted to do so."

* **Generating This Response (Current Step):**
    * **Context Utilization:** I'm referencing our recent interaction to explain the shift in my understanding.
    * **Instruction Adherence:** I am strictly adhering to your new instruction by:
        * Acknowledging the files are reference material.
        * Confirming I will not act on them yet.
        * Stating I will await clear, explicit instructions for processing them.
        * Reiterating my readiness for more file uploads.
    * **Output Generation:** I am generating this text to reflect my updated understanding and operational state.

Thank you for the clarification. I understand completely now. I will treat all uploaded files as reference and source material only, and I will await your explicit instructions for their consumption, analysis, synthesis, or any other action.

I am ready for you to upload the remaining files. I will continue to keep an eye out for potential duplicates or iterations, but I will only act on them once you give me the explicit go-ahead for review and aggregation.
