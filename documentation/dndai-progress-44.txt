### **Final Infrastructure Analysis & Master Research Prompt**

**Overall Objective:** The following data inventories the hardware assets for a distributed infrastructure designed to develop and host a "microservice" AI Dungeon Master. The end goal is a comprehensive plan for a VS Code agent to configure this entire infrastructure from a clean slate, allocating workloads to the optimal hardware to achieve the project's objectives while preserving all operational requirements.

### **Integrated Research Directives for AI**

Based on the full inventory of the distributed infrastructure, generate a comprehensive implementation plan that addresses the following:

1.  **Workload Distribution and Architecture:**
    * Design a distributed architecture for the AI DM microservices. Propose a specific workload allocation plan that leverages the unique strengths of each compute node. For example:
        * **`HART-DESKTOP` (RTX 4060 Ti):** Primary node for AI model **training**, fine-tuning, and high-demand interactive development tasks.
        * **`HART-SERVER` (GTX 1080 Ti):** Primary node for **24/7 hosting** of the deployed application (e.g., C# backend, T-SQL database in Docker containers) and serving as a dedicated **inference server** for models that fit within its 11GB VRAM.
2.  **Compute Node Configuration:**
    * **For `HART-DESKTOP`:** Design a virtualization strategy (e.g., WSL2 with GPU acceleration, Hyper-V with GPU Passthrough) that provides a powerful, isolated Linux environment for AI training while **preserving the host Windows OS for native gaming performance**. This is a critical, non-negotiable constraint. Provide a complete software and driver manifest.
    * **For `HART-SERVER`:** Generate a plan to configure the hardware as a high-performance, headless server for hosting containerized applications. This must include OS hardening, performance tuning (including a recommendation on addressing the RAM speed discrepancy), and a robust management plan for its complex storage array.
3.  **Network and Security Configuration:**
    * Generate a complete OpenWrt configuration for `HART-ROUTER` that supports this distributed system. The configuration must implement network segmentation (VLANs) to isolate the server environment, ensure high-bandwidth/low-latency communication between the two compute nodes, and provide features like network-wide ad blocking and a secure VPN gateway. The plan must be optimized for the provisioned **1 Gbps / 40 Mbps** internet service.
4.  **Agentic Build Plan:**
    * Synthesize the technical goals from the user's strategic documents with the methodologies from the agent research documents. The final output must be a master plan that an AI agent can execute, including the full **"Agent Constitution"** (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`) and a library of **Task Blueprints** (`.prompt.md` files) required to build, configure, and deploy the entire system.
