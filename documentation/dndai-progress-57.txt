That's a fantastic question, as uploading 60 individual documents would be very inefficient. The best way to provide that much source material is to **consolidate it into one or a few large text files.**

This approach is the most reliable and direct way to ensure I can process all the content without running into file upload limits or other errors.

### **Recommended Method: The Consolidated Source Document**

Please follow these steps:

1.  **Open a text editor** (like Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac, or even a Google Doc/Word document).
2.  For each of your 60 documents, **copy its entire contents**.
3.  **Paste the content** into your main text file.
4.  **Crucially, add a clear separator and a title** between each document's content. This allows me to understand where one document ends and the next begins.

Here is a simple template you can use inside your text file:

```
--- START OF DOCUMENT: [Name of your first document] ---

[Paste the full content of your first document here.]

--- END OF DOCUMENT: [Name of your first document] ---


--- START OF DOCUMENT: [Name of your second document] ---

[Paste the full content of your second document here.]

--- END OF DOCUMENT: [Name of your second document] ---

(Repeat for all 60 documents)
```

Once you have this consolidated file (or a few files, if the total is exceptionally large), you can upload it/them here. This will be the most effective way for me to ingest and analyze all of your lore and documentation for the final prompt.
