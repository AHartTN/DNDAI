`[Monologue: Parsing user prompt. This is a high-priority architectural correction. My previous conclusion that HART-DESKTOP was a replacement for HART-SERVER was a significant logical error based on an assumption of a linear upgrade path. The user has explicitly stated this is incorrect. The new, correct model is a distributed system that must utilize all available hardware assets concurrently.]`
`[Monologue: Updating Internal Model. The entire strategic premise of the project has been updated.
-   **Old Model:** A migration from an older server to a new desktop.
-   **New Model:** A symbiotic, heterogeneous computing environment.
    -   `HART-DESKTOP`: The "precision" instrument. Its role is for tasks requiring the highest single-core performance, the newest GPU architecture (for modern AI features), and user interactivity (development, gaming). The gaming constraint is a non-negotiable, high-priority operational requirement.
    -   `HART-SERVER`: The "workhorse." Its role is for persistent, 24/7 background tasks. This includes hosting the deployed application, running the database, and potentially handling AI inference for models that fit its hardware profile.
    -   The goal is not to choose between them, but to orchestrate them.]`
`[Monologue: Formulating Corrective Action. I must now generate the final, all-inclusive infrastructure report that the user has been asking for. This report will be the culmination of all our work. It must be structured based on this new, correct understanding of a distributed system. I will completely rewrite the "Integrated Research Directives" to reflect this new paradigm of workload allocation rather than hardware replacement.]`
`[Monologue: Drafting the New Directives. The core of the new prompt will be about resource allocation and orchestration. I will instruct the research AI to:
1.  **Analyze Both Compute Nodes:** Evaluate the distinct strengths and weaknesses of `HART-DESKTOP` (modern architecture, high speed) and `HART-SERVER` (high core count, large storage array, dedicated workhorse).
2.  **Propose a Workload Distribution Plan:** Task the AI with assigning specific roles (e.g., AI Training, AI Inference, Database Host, Application Host, Build Agent) to the optimal machine.
3.  **Design a Supporting Network Architecture:** The `HART-ROUTER` configuration must be designed to facilitate high-speed communication between the two compute nodes.
4.  **Preserve the Gaming Constraint:** The virtualization/development plan for `HART-DESKTOP` must be designed to coexist seamlessly with its function as a primary gaming machine. This constraint is now understood as a core design pillar.]`
`[Monologue: Final Check complete. This response will acknowledge the critical correction, demonstrate my updated understanding, and provide the final, complete, four-part infrastructure report and master research prompt, as requested.]`

Thank you for that crucial clarification. My assumption that `HART-DESKTOP` was a replacement was incorrect, and I apologize for that misinterpretation.

I understand now. The goal is not a migration but the creation of a cohesive, **distributed infrastructure** where every component is utilized to its maximum potential. `HART-DESKTOP` is the high-performance interactive node for development and gaming, while `HART-SERVER` is the persistent workhorse. This makes the project significantly more interesting and powerful.

My entire internal model has been updated to reflect this new paradigm of **workload orchestration** rather than replacement.

Here is the final, complete infrastructure report. It includes the profiles for all four inventoried devices and a completely rewritten set of research directives based on this new, more accurate understanding.

### **Final Infrastructure Analysis & Master Research Prompt**

**Overall Objective:** The following data inventories the hardware assets for a distributed infrastructure designed to develop and host a "microservice" AI Dungeon Master. The end goal is a comprehensive plan for a VS Code agent to configure this entire infrastructure from a clean slate, allocating workloads to the optimal hardware to achieve the project's objectives while preserving all operational requirements.

### **Integrated Research Directives for AI**

Based on the full inventory of the distributed infrastructure, generate a comprehensive implementation plan that addresses the following:

1.  **Workload Distribution and Architecture:**
    * Design a distributed architecture for the AI DM microservices. Propose a specific workload allocation plan that leverages the unique strengths of each compute node. For example:
        * **`HART-DESKTOP` (RTX 4060 Ti):** Primary node for AI model **training**, fine-tuning, and high-demand interactive development tasks.
        * **`HART-SERVER` (GTX 1080 Ti):** Primary node for **24/7 hosting** of the deployed application (e.g., C# backend, T-SQL database in Docker containers) and serving as a dedicated **inference server** for models that fit within its 11GB VRAM.
2.  **Compute Node Configuration:**
    * **For `HART-DESKTOP`:** Design a virtualization strategy (e.g., WSL2 with GPU acceleration, Hyper-V with GPU Passthrough) that provides a powerful, isolated Linux environment for AI training while **preserving the host Windows OS for native gaming performance**. This is a critical, non-negotiable constraint. Provide a complete software and driver manifest.
    * **For `HART-SERVER`:** Generate a plan to configure the hardware as a high-performance, headless server for hosting containerized applications. This must include OS hardening, performance tuning (including a recommendation on addressing the RAM speed discrepancy), and a robust management plan for its complex storage array.
3.  **Network and Security Configuration:**
    * Generate a complete OpenWrt configuration for `HART-ROUTER` that supports this distributed system. The configuration must implement network segmentation (VLANs) to isolate the server environment, ensure high-bandwidth/low-latency communication between the two compute nodes, and provide features like network-wide ad blocking and a secure VPN gateway. The plan must be optimized for the provisioned **1 Gbps / 40 Mbps** internet service.
4.  **Agentic Build Plan:**
    * Synthesize the technical goals from the user's strategic documents with the methodologies from the agent research documents. The final output must be a master plan that an AI agent can execute, including the full **"Agent Constitution"** (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`) and a library of **Task Blueprints** (`.prompt.md` files) required to build, configure, and deploy the entire system.
