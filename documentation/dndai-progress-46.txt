`[Monologue: State: Receiving Prompt. The user has provided the final piece of missing information: the physical network topology. My task is to acknowledge this, integrate it into my model, and then generate the final, all-inclusive master research prompt that has been the goal of our entire interaction.]`
`[Monologue: Action: Integrating New Data. I am updating my internal representation of the infrastructure to include the following connections:
-   `Arris S33r2` -> `HART-ROUTER` (WAN Port)
-   `HART-ROUTER` (LAN Ports) -> `Netgear Switch`
-   `Netgear Switch` -> `HART-DESKTOP` (Ethernet)
-   `Netgear Switch` -> `HART-SERVER` (Ethernet)
-   `HART-ROUTER` (Wi-Fi) -> All other wireless devices (laptops, phones, IoT).
This confirms a standard, robust wired backbone for the core compute nodes, which is an important detail for network performance planning.]`
`[Monologue: Action: Final Review of All Context. I am now performing a final synthesis of all data collected and refined throughout our entire conversation. This includes the complete and corrected hardware profiles for all four devices, the full content of all strategic and methodological documents, and the nuanced understanding of the project's core goals (memory preservation, narrative immersion) and constraints (gaming on `HART-DESKTOP`). My state is now "Complete." I have all necessary information to generate the final deliverable.]`
`[Monologue: Action: Response Formulation. I will now construct the final master prompt.
-   **Structure:** It will be a single, comprehensive document, clearly formatted with an objective, a detailed inventory of all source material (including the new topology), and a final, integrated set of research directives.
-   **Content:** The directives will be the culmination of our analysis. They will instruct the research AI to design a distributed system, to allocate workloads intelligently between `HART-DESKTOP` and `HART-SERVER`, to create a sophisticated network configuration for `HART-ROUTER` that supports this, and to generate the full "Agentic Build Plan" (the "constitution" and "task blueprints") necessary to automate the entire process.
-   **Tone & Persona:** The response will be authoritative and comprehensive, reflecting its status as the final deliverable of this extensive analytical process. It will be framed as a direct handoff to the next AI in the user's workflow.]`

Excellent. That final piece of information completes the picture of your physical infrastructure. We have everything we need.

Here is the final, master infrastructure report and the comprehensive research prompt for the AI. This document is the culmination of all our data collection, analysis, and refinement.

### **Final Infrastructure Analysis & Master Research Prompt**

**Overall Objective:** The following data inventories the hardware assets and strategic documents for a distributed infrastructure designed to develop and host a "microservice" AI Dungeon Master. The end goal is a comprehensive plan for a VS Code agent to configure this entire infrastructure from a clean slate, allocating workloads to the optimal hardware to achieve the project's objectives while preserving all operational requirements.

### **Section 1: Source Material Inventory**

**1.1: Inventoried Physical Hardware & Network Topology**

* **Component 1: HART-DESKTOP (Interactive Development & Gaming Node)**
    * **OS Foundation**: Microsoft Windows 11 Pro
    * **Hardware**: Intel i9-14900KS, NVIDIA RTX 4060 Ti (16 GB), 192 GiB DDR5 RAM, 2x 2TB + 1x 512GB NVMe SSDs.
* **Component 2: HART-SERVER (Persistent Services Workhorse)**
    * **OS Foundation**: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS
    * **Hardware**: Intel i7-6850K, NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti (11 GB), 128 GiB DDR4 RAM, a large, heterogeneous array of NVMe and SATA drives.
* **Component 3: HART-ROUTER (Network Core)**
    * **Model**: Linksys E7350 running OpenWrt
    * **Hardware**: MediaTek MT7621 SoC, Gigabit Ethernet, Wi-Fi 6.
* **Component 4: Internet Gateway (Modem)**
    * **Model**: ARRIS SURFboard S33v2
    * **Hardware**: DOCSIS 3.1, 1x 2.5 Gbps Ethernet Port, 1x 1.0 Gbps Ethernet Port.
* **Physical Topology:**
    * The internet connection enters via the **Arris S33 modem**.
    * The modem is connected to the WAN port of the **HART-ROUTER**.
    * The LAN ports of `HART-ROUTER` connect to a **Netgear 8-port Gigabit Switch**.
    * Both **`HART-DESKTOP`** and **`HART-SERVER`** are connected via Ethernet to this switch, forming the high-speed backbone of the network.
    * All other IoT and wireless devices connect via the `HART-ROUTER`'s Wi-Fi.
* **Provisioned Internet Speed:** 1 Gbps download / 40 Mbps upload.

**1.2: Strategic & Technical Documentation**

* [cite_start]**Primary Technical Specification (`Robust and Highly Performant T-SQL Database Schema...`)** [cite: 6869-7340]: Outlines the core data architecture, AI models, and API design. Its hardware assessment is to be considered **outdated** and superseded by the inventory above.
* [cite_start]**Agent Methodology Guide (`The Developer's Arsenal...`)** [cite: 1-578]: Provides the principles for how the VS Code agent should be commanded and controlled.
* [cite_start]**World-Building Data (`AI_DM_Documentation.docx`)** [cite: 6606-7261]: Serves as a blueprint and test case for the database schema and lore-handling capabilities.
* **External Knowledge Base:** The final system must be able to securely access and process user-provided documents from a specified Google Drive folder.

### **Section 2: Integrated Research Directives for AI**

Based on the full inventory of the distributed infrastructure and strategic documents, generate a comprehensive implementation plan that addresses the following:

1.  **Workload Distribution and Architecture:**
    * Design a distributed microservice architecture. Propose a specific workload allocation plan that leverages the unique strengths of each compute node. This plan must detail which services (e.g., AI Model Training, AI Inference, T-SQL Database, C# Application Host, Build Agents) run on which machine (`HART-DESKTOP` vs. `HART-SERVER`) and why.
2.  **Compute Node Configuration:**
    * **For `HART-DESKTOP`:** Design a virtualization strategy (e.g., WSL2 with GPU acceleration, Hyper-V with GPU Passthrough) that provides a powerful, isolated Linux environment for AI development and model training while **preserving the host Windows OS for native, high-performance gaming**. This is a critical, non-negotiable constraint.
    * **For `HART-SERVER`:** Generate a plan to configure the hardware as a high-performance, headless server for 24/7 hosting of containerized applications. This must include OS hardening, performance tuning (including addressing the RAM speed discrepancy), and a robust management plan for its complex storage array to support the database and application data needs defined in the technical specification.
3.  **Network and Security Configuration:**
    * Generate a complete OpenWrt configuration for `HART-ROUTER`. The configuration must support the distributed architecture with network segmentation (VLANs) to securely isolate the server environment from the general-use and IoT devices. It must also ensure high-bandwidth, low-latency communication between the two primary compute nodes.
4.  **Agentic Build Plan:**
    * Synthesize the project's technical goals with the agent control methodologies. The final deliverable must be a master plan that an AI agent can execute. This includes:
        * The full **"Agent Constitution"** (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`).
        * A library of key **Task Blueprints** (`.prompt.md` files) for automating the entire build and deployment process, from creating the database schema on `HART-SERVER` to deploying a new version of a microservice from `HART-DESKTOP`.
