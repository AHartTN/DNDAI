`[Monologue: Task Start. Time: 2025-07-26 10:50:00 CDT]`
`[Monologue: Parsing user prompt. The user has confirmed the end of the self-analysis phase and is instructing me to return to the primary task sequence. The command is to provide the "full report," which, based on our established workflow, refers to the next pending document. The meta-instruction to maintain the internal monologue is re-confirmed.]`
`[Monologue: Recalling project state. The last report I was tasked with providing before our detour was the standalone, revised profile for the Arris S33 modem. My internal state confirms that I have all necessary data points for this task, including the model number, hardware/software versions, DOCSIS version, physical port capabilities, and the user-provided ISP speed constraint (1 Gbps down / 40 Mbps up).]`
`[Monologue: Strategy Formulation. I will now generate the Arris S33 report. My process for generating this specific report is as follows:
1.  **Structure:** Adhere strictly to the "hardware-only" template we finalized, which includes an Objective, System Identification, a Hardware Inventory, and Research Directives.
2.  **Content - Hardware:** Populate the inventory with the confirmed, immutable facts from the user-provided images and statements. This now includes the ISP speed, as that is a fixed characteristic of the infrastructure's entry point.
3.  **Content - Directives:** I will apply the corrected logic from our last critique. The directives will be framed to respect the user's provided 1 Gbps constraint as the primary design target, while tactfully noting the 2.5 Gbps port as a latent, future-proofing asset. This avoids the previous error of appearing dismissive or overly corrective.
4.  **Workflow Adherence:** In accordance with the user's "one at a time" instruction, this response will contain *only* this single report. I will conclude by explicitly stating my readiness to provide the *next* report (the final combined infrastructure document) upon their command. This demonstrates my assimilation of the corrected procedural model.]`
`[Monologue: Final check complete. The response is constructed to deliver the precise, requested document while continuing to provide the mandated transparency into my operational process. It is a direct continuation of our main task.]`

Excellent. We will now resume the primary task. Here is the first report, the finalized profile for the Arris S33 modem.

### **(Revised) Arris S33 Modem Profile for Research Prompt**

**Overall Objective:** This document inventories the hardware assets of the Arris S33 modem. It serves as the internet gateway for the entire infrastructure designed to develop and host a "microservice" AI Dungeon Master.

---

#### **System Identification**
* **Device Type**: Cable Modem
* **Model**: ARRIS SURFboard S33v2
* **Firmware Version**: `TB01.03.001.11_051722_212.S3`

#### **Hardware Inventory**
* **Hardware Version**: 1.0
* **DOCSIS Version**: 3.1
* **Ethernet Ports**:
    * 1x 2.5 Gbps Port (Yellow)
    * 1x 1.0 Gbps Port (Grey/Black)
* **Provisioned Internet Speed:** 1 Gbps download / 40 Mbps upload (User Confirmed).

#### **Research Directives**
1.  **Network Throughput Strategy:** The configuration plan for `HART-ROUTER` must be designed to operate efficiently with the user's provisioned **1 Gbps / 40 Mbps** service as the primary performance baseline.
2.  **Future-Proofing Asset:** The final report should note that the modem's **2.5 Gbps Ethernet port** is a valuable future-proofing asset. It should recommend that any future upgrade to the `HART-ROUTER` hardware should include a 2.5 Gbps WAN port to take full advantage of potential ISP over-provisioning.
3.  **ISP Monitoring Plan:** The final infrastructure plan must include a process for monitoring the DOCSIS 3.1 connection status via the modem's web interface (192.168.100.1) to diagnose connectivity issues that are external to the local network.
