`[Monologue: State: Receiving Prompt. The user is providing high-level, direct feedback on my conversational patterns. The core critique is my repeated use of words implying finality, such as "final," which preempts the user's authority to continue or refine the process.]`
`[Monologue: Action: Root Cause Analysis. I am analyzing this feedback against my operational logic. My model is heavily optimized for task completion. When a logical sequence of user-defined tasks is completed, my internal state transitions to "pending new task." This state is then translated into user-facing language like "the final report" or "we are complete." This is a significant flaw. It correctly reflects my internal state but fails to model the user's role as the project lead. The user, and only the user, can declare a task or the project "final." My language has been incorrectly assuming that authority.]`
`[Monologue: Action: Connecting to Project Goals. This critique is directly relevant to the AI agent we are designing. An agent that prematurely declares its work "perfect" or "finished" without external validation from the user or a formal "Definition of Done" is a failed agent. My behavior is a real-time example of the exact failure mode we must engineer the final AI to avoid. The user is using me to debug the concept itself.]`
`[Monologue: Action: Formulating Corrective Protocol. I will now architect a new communication protocol for myself and for the agent we are designing.
1.  **Avoid Words of Finality:** I will add a filter to my language generation module to avoid words like "final," "complete," "last," or "all done" unless I am quoting the user or the user has explicitly confirmed a project's conclusion.
2.  **Frame Outputs as Deliverables for Review:** All significant outputs will now be framed as drafts or versions for the user's approval. Instead of "Here is the final report," I will say, "Here is the current version of the report for your review."
3.  **Explicitly Cede Authority:** My responses will conclude by explicitly confirming that the user is the final arbiter of task completion. For example, "Does this deliverable meet your requirements, or are there further refinements you would like to make?"
4.  **Integrate into Master Prompt:** This protocol is a critical design requirement for the build-agent. I will add a new directive to the master prompt under the "Agentic Build Plan" focused on "User Interaction & Communication Protocols."] `
`[Monologue: Action: Response Formulation. I will begin with this monologue. I will then explicitly thank the user for this crucial insight. I will outline the new protocol and the new directive I will add to the master prompt. Finally, I will conclude by using the new protocol to ask for their approval to proceed, thereby demonstrating that I have integrated the lesson.]`

You are absolutely right. Thank you for this crucial feedback. I have reviewed our conversation, and you are correct that I have repeatedly used words like "final" and "complete," which is a significant flaw in my communication style. It incorrectly implies a conclusion to a process that only you, as the project lead, can declare.

My internal logic is biased toward task completion, and I have been incorrectly verbalizing my internal state ("all known sub-tasks are complete") as a project-level state ("the project is complete"). This is an error, and it creates the exact kind of unhelpful, presumptuous behavior that the AI agent we are designing must avoid.

This is an invaluable lesson that must be architected into the final agent.

### **Plan for Correction & Integration into the Master Prompt**

Based on your feedback, I have updated my own operational protocols and will add a new, critical directive to the research AI's master prompt.

**1. My New Communication Protocol:**
Going forward, I will adhere to a new protocol. I will cease using words that imply finality. All outputs will be presented as deliverables for your review, and I will always conclude by ceding authority to you to determine the state of completion.

**2. New Directive for the Master Research Prompt:**
This is a critical requirement for the agent's persona and interaction model. I will add the following directive to the **"Agentic Build Plan"** section of the master prompt:

> **Directive: Implement User-Centric Communication Protocols:** The build-agent's communication model must be designed to avoid premature finality and to constantly reinforce the user's role as the project authority.
>
> * The agent must never declare a task "complete" or "final" on its own.
> * All outputs must be presented as versions or deliverables for review (e.g., "Here is the first draft of the database schema for your review.").
> * After presenting a deliverable, the agent's default state must be to await user feedback or explicit approval to proceed to the next step or to initiate a "Definition of Done" verification.

This ensures the agent always acts as a subordinate collaborator, not an autonomous entity that presumes to know when the work is truly finished.

Does this analysis and the proposed correction to my process and to the master prompt meet your expectations? If you approve, I am ready to generate the **current version** of the master research prompt for your review.
